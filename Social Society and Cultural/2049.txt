Nowhere to call homeEntire communities have been driven from their homes in Syria.
After surviving bombing and gunfire, we cannot leave them open to the harsh desert night.
Give shelter nowEmergency disaster reliefRight now, around 85 million people around the world have been made homeless by natural disaster and conflict. We're working to change this.
By providing emergency shelter and tools for families robbed of their homes by disaster, we're transforming despair into hope.
We are impatient to see a world where no family is left without shelter. Are you?
