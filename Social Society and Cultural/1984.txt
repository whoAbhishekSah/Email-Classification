As of April 2014 no new items have been added to this Website. We hope visitors to the site will continue to find the content that is here useful.
The research work of those who have contributed to this site in the past can now be found at the Centre for Parenting Culture Studies (CPCS) website.
You might be particularly interested to read items contained in the Pregnancy section of the website.
If you want to keep up to date with the latest developments in abortion policy and practice, wed recommend that you visit Reproductive Review, an update of news and comment on abortion and other reproductive choice issues produced by British Pregnancy Advisory Service.
