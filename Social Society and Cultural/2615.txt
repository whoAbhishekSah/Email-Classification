George Wombwell Menagerie Website
This website is dedicated to the Travelling Menagerie and in particular, but not exclusively, George Wombwell, the most famous Victorian Showman and Menagerist.
The site has taken several years to materialise into a form that the authors are happy to publish. Thank you for your patience.
