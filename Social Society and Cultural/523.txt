Gay History and Literature: Essays by Rictor Norton
Welcome to my website with a special focus on gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender history.
(Updated 7 January 2017)
It contains numerous articles that I've written over many years, as well as a large selection of primary documents, plus bibliographies and useful links to other websites on LGBTQ history. It also contains some of my writing on non-gay eighteenth-century history and literature.
