Diamond Jubilee
The International Police Association celebrates its Diamond Jubilee in 2010 and the British Section - the founding Section - has been marking the occasion with events throughout the length and breadth of the United Kingdom. Here’s a flavour of what’s been happening.
The 2010 National Council Meeting of Section UK was held in East Grinstead, thus taking the celebrations into the south east of England. Members from the area, the Metropolis and the National Executive team worked on a programme of events around the dates of the meeting, which included a Golf Tournament. The jewel in the crown of the programme was a special service at Guildford Cathedral in Surrey which featured a stained glass window commemorating IPA. Invitations were issued to VIPs and notable IPA members to come and assist in the re-dedication of the window, a personal gift by the 3rd President of Section UK and simultaneous International President Sir Peter Matthews. The international committee – the Permanent Executive Bureau – was in attendance. Members of Section IPA attending the march in Arnhem used the opportunity for a symbolic handover of a special Diamond Jubilee Baton to Section Netherlands.  Netherlands is the second Section of the International Police Association so the Baton was handed over in readiness for their Diamond Jubilee Celebrations.
Len Washer, IPA member No. 4 was featured on a special edition picture produced by cartoonist Jedd. The picture, depicting officers in period uniforms from the first seven Sections, has been reproduced on Christmas cards and memorabilia.  These items are available for sale.Nottingham, situated in the east Midlands, is the home of the British Section Administrative Centre and International Administration Centre.  The Diamond Jubilee flag was raised at the outset of the year and an Open Day was held on Saturday 24 July.  This allowed members the opportunity to visit, see the building and meet with members and staff from Section UK and the IAC.  Tours of Trent Bridge Cricket Ground and Nottingham City highlights took place. The day concluded with a dazzling gala dinner hosted by Nottinghamshire Branch.
In the North of England, Durham Branch members held a friendship week ‘Historic Durham’.  The city of York was the venue for an international football competition in September. The Camping and Caravan Group celebrated the Diamond Jubilee with a nationwide Roadshow, the centrepiece of which was a rally in Liverpool. In Northern Ireland, members hosted a friendship week ‘A Taste of Ulster’. There was also a delegation of national and regional office holders attending the National Police Memorial Day in Belfast.
In Scotland, there was a friendship week in Stirling, involvement in the Edinburgh Military Tattoo the annual traditional Burns Suppers.
