A VULCAN bomber flew over the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh's yacht at the start of their Diamond Jubilee visit to the North-East.
The royal couple were on board Leander in the Port of Sunderland to see the sun glint on the V-shaped bomber's wings as it went past.
Crowds cheered the Queen, who wore an orange dress and coat by Stewart Parvin with matching hat by Rachel Trevor-Morgan, as she disembarked.

The Vulcan bomber was first flown in 1952, the year she became Queen.
She was accompanied by the Duke as they visited a temporary exhibition depicting scenes from every decade of her reign.
Local athletics star Steve Cram was among the dignitaries who met the royal couple.
He said: "She asked me if we are ready for the Olympics and, of course, the answer's yes.
"Thirty years ago she presented me with a gold at the Brisbane Commonwealth Games and I cannot believe it is that long ago.
"I was talking to someone who is around 19 or 20 last night and what is so nice is that she was really excited when I told her I was going to see the Queen.
"It's testimony to what she still means to people.".
As the Queen continued her tour of the region Her Majesty revisited the Tyne Tunnel, 45 years after she opened the original transport link.
Waiting schoolchildren waved flags and burst into a spontaneous rendition of God Save The Queen as her state Bentley drew up to the south end of the underpass.
The Queen started a wheelchair race through the tunnel before she and the Duke of Edinburgh spoke to those who worked on the recently-completed Tyne Tunnel Two project, which enhances links between
North and South Tyneside .
Windswept crowds lined an overhead bridge draped with Union Flags to catch a glimpse of the royals as cloud gave way to bright sunlight, peppered by drizzly showers.
The Queen planted a memorial tree by the entrance before being presented with a bouquet by Giselle Greulich-Smith, whose mother works on the site.
She and the Duke then travelled to the north end, where she officially opened Tyne Tunnel Two.
She told the crowd: "Forty-five years after I came here to open the first road tunnel under the River Tyne, Prince Philip and I are delighted to return for the official opening of Tyne Tunnel Two.
"I know that the first tunnel has made a huge difference to people's lives in Tyneside, opening up access for many communities once so divided by this great river."
She said the project, which took four years and opened to vehicles last November, has given a better quality of life to residents, businesses and commuters.
"Time once lost to traffic jams can now be spent with family and friends," she said.
"Now the project is complete, I would like to congratulate all those who have played a part.
"You can all be proud of a job well done.
"I now have pleasure in declaring open Tyne Tunnel Two."
The Queen and the Duke moved on to Gateshead international stadium in a maroon open-top Range Rover where they were cheered by more than 6,000 primary school children.
After cheering enthusiastically as the royal couple were driven around the athletics stadium's running track, the children performed the specially-commissioned Diamond Jubilee Song.
Afterwards, Chris Strong, sport, lifestyle and health development manager with Gateshead Council, introduced local children to the Queen.
He said: "It was a proud, amazing moment which all of us will remember for a long time."
A new Olympic-standard white water course at the Tees Barrage opened with a bang when the Queen hit a button to part the floodgates and set off a pyrotechnic display this afternoon on her final
stop.
Thousands turned out to watch the opening ceremony, which was followed by a flotilla.
The course in Stockton, one of only a handful of its kind in the country, will be used to train future Olympic contestants.
The Queen and Duke met those who use the facility, including promising young canoeists.
Calum Cresser, 15, of Darlington, County Durham, who trains on the barrage, said: "She asked me how long Id been doing it, so I told her seven years.
"She wasn't as I expected. I expected her to have a different voice.
"I've been looking forward to meeting her - we were told about it months ago. I feel overwhelmed."
Schoolchildren lined the approach to the rapids and some presented her with bouquets.
The Queen and Duke head south to visit Leeds tomorrow.
