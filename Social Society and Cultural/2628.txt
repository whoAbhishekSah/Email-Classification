What is GO Mammoth?Go Mammoth is the ultimate club for busy & active adults looking to maximise their spare time through playing sport, keeping fit, going on adventures & socialising with friends.
As the UK's largest lifestyle club, GO Mammoth exists simply to make your life more fun... without the seriousness and commitment of joining a specialist sports club and a x100 more social than joining a gym.
So, grab some work colleagues or mates and join the fun today or sign up as an individual (over half of new members do!) and make loads of new friends.
