No root page found
Contao Open Source CMS
No root page found
What's the matter?
There is no website root page which matches the requested language and/or domain name.
How can I fix the issue?
If you have explicitly set a language, try to go to the top level and see whether you are being redirected. Otherwise contact the webmaster and let him know that there is something wrong.
To customize this notice, create a custom template file named templates/be_no_root.html5.
