Streets Alive builds neighbourliness and community spirit
We are the national group promoting street parties and run streetparty.org.uk. We help residents and groups to organise these and other neighbours' events such as picnics, tea parties and street play to build communities from the street up. We helped Bristol to become the UKâs street party capital with over 100 held each year.
Our communities are more mobile and diverse, and so Streets Alive encourages 'excuses to meet' in streets and for residents to build relationships.
Age Friendly Streets Campaign
Our new neighbours' campaign is for mixing generations. Our ageing society needs to find new ways for older and younger people to support each other and reduce isolation. Early results from the campaign show that it works - see news. Ask us for help in running the campaign locally in your area.
Activate My Street is possible once residents are engaged by:
organising social, cultural, sporting, and environmental activities
helping children to play in the street
signposting residents to support and advice services
recruiting volunteers for voluntary groups and charities
Join us in transforming the country from the street up.
