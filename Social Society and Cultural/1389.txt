Distinctive, Valued, Personal: Why Social Care Matters
CALLS FOR PRIME MINISTER TO BEGIN CROSS-PARTY PROCESS ON HEALTH AND CARE FUNDING
Theresa May must urgently begin a cross-party process to find a long-term solution to the current crisis in health and social care funding. That’s the call in an open letter to the Prime Minister signed by 75 organisations and leading voices in the sector including Independent Age, Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS), Care England, Patients Association, Royal College of GPs, Royal College of Nursing, Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers (SOLACE), Leonard Cheshire Disability, Marie Curie and RNIB. The letter warns that “2017 simply cannot be another year where these huge issues are ducked” and that unless the Prime Minister takes “a bolder approach millions of older, ill and disabled people and their carers will continue to be badly let down.”
Please see below for the full press release and the open letter.
ADASS Responds to the Autumn Statement 2016
Ray James, Immediate Past President of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, said:
“The Government’s failure to provide desperately needed extra funding for adult social care means that this winter and throughout next year we will inevitably see more older and disabled people not getting the care and support they rely upon to survive each day, an even greater toll being placed on the 6.5 million family members and other carers, increasing delays in the NHS, and even more care homes closing and growing gaps and failures in the care market.
ADASS Response to Local Government Finance Settlement - woefully inadequate
Responding to today’s Local Government Finance Settlement, Ray James, Immediate Past President of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, said:
“We welcome the Government’s acknowledgement of the need to address the crisis in social care funding but the amount brought forward for 2017/18 is woefully inadequate.
Autumn Statement 2016 Representation by ADASS
This is the ADASS submission to HM Treasury ahead of the Autumn statement on 23 November 2016. It seeks to influence the government to sufficiently address the recognition of and funding for the vital services and supports that adult social care provides.

Harold Bodmer - Obituary
As the opening chords of Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika, God Bless Africa, soared through the magnificent Norman nave and transepts of Norwich Cathedral, it was clear that the service of thanksgiving for the life of Harold Bodmer would be very much like the man himself: uniquely individual, deeply thoughtful and just a little bit mischievous.
Harold, taken from us suddenly and shockingly at 61, part-way through his ADASS presidency, was the product of two cultures represented exactly by the service: the traditional singing and the bold, bright colours of African choirs, summoning vibrant images of his homeland, interwoven with Abide With Me and the darker shades of dress of the hundreds of mourners from the country he adopted. Our two tribes stood united in grief.
