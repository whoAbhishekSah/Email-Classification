Doing Epic StuffSince 2005
Beer EvolutionIt’s been ten years since we began our brewing journey, August 2005 when there were three guys, one Toyota pickup truck, some borrowed sacks of malt and an Industrial unit full of ambition. A lot has happened since then, awards have been won, glasses have been raised and tears have been shed. (OK the tears were poetic licence but you get the drift) The one thing that hasn’t changed is our passion, our love for Beer, making it, tasting it and discovering it.
