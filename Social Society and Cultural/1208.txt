Ulster Unionists help plant out Jubilee Park
As part of the Diamond Jubilee 2012 celebrations, I, along with fellow local Ulster
Unionist representatives, Roy Beggs MLA  and Ald Roy
Beggs, assisted Parks Staff with the tree planting event organised by Larne Borough
Council, in partnership with The Woodland Trust at Jubilee Park, Glynn.
Forming part of a UK-wide scheme aimed at increasing woodland cover
to celebrate the Queen's historic 60th anniversary, around 6 million
trees will be planted around the country, including many within Larne
Borough.
Roy Beggs MLA said; "The Jubilee Park was opened in June 1977 to
celebrate Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee and the play ground had
been up-graded in recent years following an active local community
campaign. It is very appropriate to further enhance the park in 2012 as
part of the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee celebrations.”
The variety of trees planted will form a woodland copse of species
native to Northern Ireland and will complimnent the surrounding woodland
and wildlife habitats.
Cllr Mark McKinty said, “Jubilee Park has
a lot of history and is a great location. The riverside park is a
wonderful local asset for the Village of Glynn and by planting
additional trees in Queen’s Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee year, we will
not only be enriching the environment, but also creating an important
community space for future generations - I look forward to visiting this
site and watching the trees grow”.
I encourage you to visit this magnificnt site in the Glynn... the backdrop of hills and mature trees is beautiful, along with the  sound of running water in the river on one side and a small burn on the other.
The tree planting event took place last Friday, 6th April from 9-5pm.
Trees were provided free of charge and everyone was welcome to take
part.
