TINTAGEL-PAST-PRESENT-FUTURE
Tintagel is situated on the North coast of Cornwall and is renowned for its association with the legend of King Arthur and his
Knights of the Round Table. The magic of the association is captured particularly by the castle, King Arthur's Castle, which is
reached by steps leading from the main land. Originally the Castle was attached to the main land but by erosion over the years a
bridge had to be built. It is a hard climb to the top but well worth it. The Castle is maintained by English Heritage. There are many
beaches in the area, for surfers Trebarwith and Bossiney are the main attractions, but the Castle Beach is renowned as a very safe
bathing beach. For the visitor to Tintagel there are many attractions to see in the village apart from the cliffs area. Nearby are the
lovely villages of Boscastle and Delabole, the town of Camelford and the pretty fishing village of Port Isaac.
