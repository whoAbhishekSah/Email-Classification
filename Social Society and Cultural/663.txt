to Ancoats Little Italy, Manchester, England, UK
Introduction
In the 19th century there was an exodus of Italian immigrants, due to
the political and economic situation, travelling from every region of
Italy, particularly southern Italy, Lazio and Campagna, to the UK. Some
settled in the Ancoats area of the city of Manchester, north west England,
and for the next hundred years they created what became known as Manchester's
"Ancoats Little Italy".
They enhanced the Catholic Whit Walk, they pioneered the British ice
cream industry, and survived the turmoil of the second world war.
The many families who brought colour and life to this area are a constant
source of interest to those interested in genealogy and their family history.
