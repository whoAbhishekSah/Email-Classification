Benjamin
Powell.
Benjamin Powell was born about 1813 at Brecon in
Brecknockshire, Wales. His occupation is given in the 1851 census as a
boatman. This would have been on the Monmouthshire to Brecon canal.
which ran between Newport and Brecon. He met Elizabeth Jenkins
from Llandovery, Camarthenshire, Wales and they were married. They had
six children and their names were....John Powell,
born 1834, Benjamin Powell, born 1837,
Rees Powell, 1841, William Powell,
born 1843,  Thomas Powell, born,1846 and
Mary Powell, 1849.
The
details of the family in the 1851 census is as follows...
Powell Benjamin,
head, aged 37, boatman, born Brecon
Elizabeth,       wife, aged 40,
born Camarthenshire
John,
son,  aged 17, boatman,
born Brecon
Benjamin,
son,  aged 13, boatman,
born Brecon
Rees,
son,  aged 10,
born Brecon
William,
son,  aged  8,
born Llantarnam, Mon
Thomas,           son,
aged  5,
born Llantarnam, Mon
Mary,
dau, aged 2,
born Bettws, Mon
Some of
their children were I believe born aboard the canal barge's or at the
canal wharf's and Mary was born at Bettws, Monmouthshire where the
canal still run's through.   In those days the area was
countryside with few houses and it is possible that she was born
aboard the barge on the canal in this area.
Mary
Powell went on to marry John Gillard from Taunton, North Devon.
(many thanks to
Gwynneth Wright for the census information)
Watton Wharf,
Brecon
Whatton wharf is in Brecon
town, Powys. Depending from where you start, it is either the
beginning  or the end of a journey on the Brecon - Monmouthshire
canal.  It was in this area that Benjamin Powell's first children
were born (see census's).

John Gillard
John
Gillard married Mary Powell at the St. Michael's and All
Saints church in Llantarnam, Monmouthshire on  December 24, 1877.
The given father's names are William Gillard, an agricultural
labourer and Benjamin Powell, a labourer.
Until
recently, other than the marriage certificate, the first record of
John Gillard and his family that I had is taken from the 1881 census
(as below) but other information has now come to light.
John
Gillard and his family are living in Albion Road, Trevethin,
Monmouthshire. He is aged 31 and his occupation is given as a wire
cleaner and he was born in Devon
Following on from the above, further information has been obtained
from the 1851 census and the IGI records. It is known that John
Gillard record in the 1901 census says that he is from Church, Devon
and that on his marriage certificate his fathers name is William.
John's birth year varies with his age in different census's but can be
put between 1848 - 1850 and so the following information is loosely
based on these records until definite proof is found.
William
Gillard was born in 1820 at Churchstanton, Devon and married Sarah
Wide in Wellington, Somerset about 1845. In the 1851 census the family
are living in Churchstanton with their son John aged 3 and William's
father and mother in law. As well as the information about John
Gillard and his family that is in the 1881 census as above, this
census also lists a Samuel Gillard and gives his place of birth as
Church Saunton. It also gives his occupation as a wire cleaner and in
all probability, he his John's brother. John's occupation at that time
was also a wire cleaner. There is also a William Gillard living in the
same area as Sam and John, his name is William, aged 22 and comes from
Devon.
