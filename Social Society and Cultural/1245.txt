About
A global interactive archive of The Queen’s visits and her Jubilee celebrations to mark the Diamond Jubilee
Her Majesty visits a large number of places around the UK every year. Throughout her reign, The Queen has also travelled overseas more than any other Sovereign in history. In 60 years, Her Majesty has made an impressive 261 official overseas visits to 116 different countries.
The Queen celebrated her Silver Jubilee in 1977 and her Golden Jubilee in 2002, and celebrations were held for both around the world.
We'd like to collect as many contributions as possible, from individuals and archives all around the world, to help tell the rich history of these visits and celebrations.
