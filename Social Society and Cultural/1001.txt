Award Winning Free Range Eggs
Everyone likes a winner as our Free Range hens will testify. At Birchgrove we only have healthy and happy hens, with acres of land for them to roam and explore they produce truly eggsellent eggs so everyone’s a winner!
Birchgrove eggs are free range, and assured under the RSPCA Freedom Food scheme, which ensures that the highest standards of welfare, hygiene and environmental practices are in place and monitored.
Birchgrove is a quality food farmed with a conscience. Supplying eggs throughout Wales all our customers can be guaranteed they are buying a quality product from a family run business, where the hen and egg are equal.
