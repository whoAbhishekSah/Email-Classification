Featured Poem
A ball and a field
Spirit of Football 23rd February 2012
From weeping and cheering
from street to stadium
from winter to summer
and from dawn til dusk,
this game connects and shares in all
a care to care for each and everyone of us.
Love it or hate it
win or lose
a passion for fighting
joining in and joining up
playing up and playing out
with an agreed set of rules,
a spending of energy
and release of tension
where the battle is safe
and the guns shoot compassion
where I share my street
and shoot to kill mistrust and fear
and die for the love of the game,
where the pain of loss can be quietly loved
and the joy of triumph tossed high above
whilst one holds respect for the other and vice versa
the other for the one..
the one spirit of football
the one love
a ball and a field
a sword and a shield
this one’s for you
and this one’s for me
be proud and humble
steady and stumble
play on
play out
play with and without
play it down and out.

Lovely words Mike
If you key Munich or Busby Babes in the Search magnifying glass button above you will find all the poesm we’ve received since 2000 on the Munich Air crash (and Hillsborough).

Great poem. My favorite line is the ‘worn down by fame’ much like my favorite artist.

Thanks, Christian! I never had any problems with FootballPoets.org. You wouldn’t know if anything was plagiarized. You all are great. Thank you for giving me credit for my work.

Hi Scott, thanks for pointing this out. I have assigned the poem to your poet profile and changed the title to your original one. I have also notified the site editor and asked him to investigate the other poems that “Craig Wilson” submitted to this site during the period when he was active here i.e. between Nov 2004 and Feb 2005. Please accept our sincere apologies – all content here is contributed by the community and we make it clear that only original work may be submitted. Sometimes, it seems, plagiarised work slips through. Hopefully it won’t deter your from contributing in future.

Nice. I was 15 years-old when I wrote this for a high school english class…in 1995:
You probably found it here: http://www.illyria.com/soccer/socbag.html
I suppose I should be flattered.
Looks like you changed the title, fixed my spelling in one spot in verse four, changed a word in the last line, and added some commas.  While I appreciate the revisions, I don’t believe those changes make this poem yours.
