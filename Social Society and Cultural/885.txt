(Published on

The seaside
village of Llangrannog lies on the coast of Ceredigion, in a narrow valley
which the river Hawen makes its rapid way into Cardigan Bay. Another small
stream, Nant Eisteddfa flows into the sea, but is mostly hidden and emerges
as an outfall near the boat ramp.
In the lower part, the valley is so
steep as to form a virtual ravine, the river Hawen falling at one point as a
waterfall.
The village is spread along the valley,
the older settlement, including the church, being above the waterfall,
hidden from view of the sea .The lower or Beach village was built in later,
safer years and for many years was a small flourishing commercial port."
The above is
an extract from "The Story of Llangrannog", by Mervyn Davies, published by
E.L. Jones & Sons, Cardigan.
Today Llangrannog is well
known to thousands of visitors as a tranquil, safe, seaside holiday village,
with two public houses,
Pentre Arms
and
The Ship,
two cafe/restaurants,
Patio Cafe
and
The Beach Hut
(formerly Y Gegin Fach). It
also has a general store,
Glynafon
. The nearest Post Office is
at
Blaencelyn,
which is located on the Llangrannog to Cwmtydu road.
