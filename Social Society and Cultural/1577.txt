Are you consistently trying and failing to cut down or stop smoking cannabis?
Does Marijuana take more from you than it gives back?
Clearhead offers information and tools for dope smokers who want to make positive changes in their lives.
When I was smoking cannabis it was the most important relationship in my life: more important than my family, my friends, my partner or my job. I smoked it to help me wake up and to help me get to sleep. When I was without it I was irritable, anxious and could concentrate on little else until I was stoned again. However, if you had asked me at any time whether I was addicted, I would have laughed in your face and denied it. I finally found the strength to quit in 2002.J L
