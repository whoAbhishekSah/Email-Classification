Excitement in Corby at the Queen’s planned Diamond Jubilee visit

Have your say
A right royal occasion is being planned to welcome the Queen to Corby.
Her Majesty has announced she will visit the town as part of her diamond jubilee celebrations in June.Buckingham Palace confirmed that Queen Elizabeth will visit with the Duke of Edinburgh as part of a larger tour of towns in the East Midlands on June 13 and 14.
But officials are keeping the exact details a secret until closer to the visit.
Speculation about where the Queen will go and who she will meet has already started.The last time she was in Corby was in 2001 when she unveiled a plaque to open Rockingham Speedway.There are plenty of new buildings in the town that are fit for a royal visit, and many dignitaries who are dying to meet her.Town mayor Gail McDade said she hoped the visit was connected to Corby’s city status bid. She said: “She is only going to two places that have bid for city status: Corby and Perth.
“Who knows what that means but I hope it is good news.“Unfortunately she is coming a couple of weeks after my year in office finishes but I do hope that I get to meet her.“I think a good place for her to visit would be East Carlton park as it is so beautiful.”In 1961 the Queen visited Corby to open the new town centre. Coronation Park is also named in her honour and several town centre streets including Elizabeth Street, Alexandra Road, George Street, Queen’s Square and the former Windsor Place have Royal monickers.
Town centre manager Daniel Pickard said he would welcome a visit from Her Majesty – although it would not be the first time he has met her.He said: “I met her six years ago when she came to a shopping centre I ran in Stafford.“There was lots of royal protection officers around and it was very high security.“I got to have tea with her afterwards, along with 300 other people, and she said good afternoon to me.“I definitely think she could come and look at the new town centre we have here.
“I have not contacted the palace myself as I think the etiquette with such events is that you wait for them to contact you first.“But I shall be waiting for them to get in touch.”The other towns the Queen will be visiting during her tour of the East Midlands are Nottingham, Burghley, Stevenage and Hatfield. She could stay at Burghley House overnight, where Queen Victoria and Prince Albert stayed in 1844.MP for Corby Louise Mensch said she was absolutely thrilled that the Queen had chosen to visit the town.She said: “We will be delighted to welcome Her Majesty to Corby.“I am not sure of the protocol so I don’t know if I will be meeting her yet but I do hope so.“I have never met her before.“Corby will give her a wonderful welcome.”It is also thought that the Queen may go to one of the town’s new educational establishments – suggestions include Tresham College’s new building in Oakley Road or the Corby Business Academy in Academy Way.Royal visits are traditionally hosted by the Queen’s representative, the Lord Lieutenant.But the office of the Lord Lieutenant of Northamptonshire, Lady Juliet Townsend, would only confirm that the visit was taking place, and said they would not give further details of the visit until the palace released the information.
