Commission on Vulnerable Employment
In 2007, the TUC set up a new Commission to look into the issues surrounding vulnerable employment.
The 16 Commission members were drawn from employer, academic, trade union and civil society backgrounds, bringing with them a wealth of different experiences and perspectives.
The Commission has now produced its final report. It has drawn on evidence from new research, a public consultation, a programme of regional visits and expert testimony.
Its recommendations consider how government, civil society organisations, employers and trade unions can work together to improve the lives of Britain’s most vulnerable workers.
