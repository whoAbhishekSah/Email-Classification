Queen's Diamond Jubilee 2012
The main programme announced by Buckingham Palace for the central weekend to celebrate The Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012 took place from Saturday 2nd June to Tuesday 5th June. In addition to national and international events, there were celebratory activities in communities across Surrey.
HM The Queen celebrates in SurreyHM The Queen and HRH The Duke of Edinburgh, accompanied by other members of the Royal Family, attended the Derby meeting at Epsom Racecourse, at the start of the Diamond Jubilee weekend celebrations. Greeted by the (then) Lord-Lieutenant, Dame Sarah Goad, they were then introduced to representatives from the Surrey community. To commemorate her Diamond Jubilee, The Queen was presented with a gift from the people of Surrey, handmade by craftsmen in the county.
Jubilee Carriage DriveOn Saturday 3rd June, the (then) Lord-Lieutenant and her husband joined the lead carriage for The Brockham Harness Club Diamond Jubilee Carriage Drive. From Denbies Wine Estate, the carriages drove through Dorking where, at the White Horse, Dame Sarah Goad presented a commemorative brass to each of the 24 carriages in the parade, before the carriages returned to Denbies.
Diamond Jubilee ‘Best in Show’There was a Diamond Jubilee theme throughout the Surrey County Show at Guildford on 4th June. TRHs the Earl and Countess of Wessex were welcomed by the Vice Lord-Lieutenant, Mr Gordon Lee-Steere. The Royal visitors were shown round the cattle lines and the sheep and pig marquees; the Earl presented the prize for Best In Milk Heifer and the Countess presented the Group of Three Sheep Championship to a trio of Southdowns from a flock in Lewes.
Jubilant Godalming The Earl and Countess of Wessex continued to Godalming, where they joined Diamond Jubilee revellers at a Sport for All Day, with the Earl starting the Mayor’s tug of war competition. There were Fun and 5k/10k runs and a Diamond Jubilee Picnic. In the evening, residents joined a procession through the town, the lighting of a beacon, and celebratory fireworks.
Jubilee Beacons Communities across Surrey commemorated the Diamond Jubilee on the evening of 4th June, as part of a network of 2012 beacons lit throughout the United Kingdom. At Betchworth House, the beacon was lit by Mrs Joosje Hamilton (below) while in the village of Hambledon 250 residents attended a pre-lighting party before processing to watch the gorse beacon being lit by the current High Sheriff of Surrey, Mrs Karin Sehmer (far below).
