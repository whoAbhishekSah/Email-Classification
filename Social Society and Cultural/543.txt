Welcome to Grosmont Village
'The most beautiful village in Britain' is how Jan Morris, the acclaimed travel writer, described Grosmont, with its ancient church and castle. Situated near the Welsh Border with England it lies in the valley of the River Monnow between the Brecon Beacons National Park and the Wye Valley Area of Outstanding Beauty.
However, Grosmont offers more than just its history and scenery.
It is a friendly, lively and thriving community.
