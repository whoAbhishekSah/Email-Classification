When you educate a girl, everything changes
All of our programs begin with an individual girl in rural Africa. We look at the world from her perspective, and work with communities to dismantle the barriers to her education, and to a life of independence and leadership.

Through the education and empowerment that Camfed provides, these resilient girls and young women are transforming their lives, and the lives of many other vulnerable children in their communities.

Give the gift of education
