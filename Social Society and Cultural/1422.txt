ICC chiefs condemn racist abuse
Aussies denied by defiant Rudolph
The International Cricket Council is determined to stamp out racist abuse at Test grounds after problems during the Australia v South Africa game in Perth.
South Africa complained about the crowd directing abuse towards some of their players during the third day's play.
ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said such behaviour would not be tolerated.
"The fact that this is an isolated incident by a small number of people in one country does not lessen the game's resolve to address the issue," he said.
"We have in place an international anti-racism policy which all of our members have signed up to.
"Each of our members is committed to implementing this policy which deals firmly with the issue including the ejection of those responsible for this type of unacceptable behaviour.
We hope this will not happen again and appeal to all to abide by the ICC's anti-racism policy
United Cricket Board chief Gerald Majola
"The ICC has now discussed this issue with Cricket Australia and the United Cricket Board of South Africa.
"Cricket Australia has reaffirmed its commitment to the ICC's Anti-Racism policy and has emphasised that it is taking the matter very seriously."
The South Africans complained to match referee Chris Broad as well as John
Rhodes, who manages the ICC's Anti-Corruption and Security unit in
Australia and New Zealand.
A statement issued by the team's management said
racial slurs and chants were directed at Ashwell Prince, Garnett
Kruger, Shaun Pollock, Justin Kemp and Makhaya Ntini during the third day's play.
Australian captain Ricky Ponting condemned the reported abuse.
"There's no room in sport for racism whatsoever," Ponting said.
"The players are all very aware of that (and) the crowd needs to be aware of that and enjoy the game for what it is," he added.
United Cricket Board chief Gerald Majola said he hoped the incidents would not be repeated.
"We appeal to all to abide by the ICC's anti-racism policy," he said.
"We thank the relevant authorities for the assurance that the necessary protection for our players for the rest of the tour will be in place."
Meanwhile Cricket Australia responded by confirming a zero tolerance policy towards those involved in racist chants.
"Cultural diversity is one of global cricket's strengths and enduring characteristics," said public affairs manager Peter Young.
"The spirit of cricket demands that the game be played and staged in a good spirit and CA wants all cricketers and cricket lovers to feel welcome wherever they play or attend international games.
"On top of that, CA and its constituent state cricket associations support the International Cricket Council's (ICC) formal anti-racism policy which imposes conditions, such as ejection, on patrons who misbehave."
