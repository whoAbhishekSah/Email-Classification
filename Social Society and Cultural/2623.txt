Welcome to Girls Gone By Publishers
Girls Gone By Publishers re-publishes some of the most popular fiction from the twentieth century, concentrating on those titles which are most sought after, and difficult to find on the second-hand market.
We use the complete and unabridged text from first editions (except in very rare cases when we cannot find a first edition), together with all the illustrations. All of our books come with at least one introduction by an 'expert' in the field, and with a publishing history which includes illustrations of all editions (these often make fascinating reading).
Our aim is to make these books available at affordable prices, and to make ownership possible not only for existing collectors but also for new collectors so that the survival of the books is continued.
We also have a programme of non fiction titles related to the genre. These are larger in format, and include a lot of black-and-white illustrations. In addition, some of them have colour plates. You will find these under their respective authors in the Books in Print section.
For news of what is happening, please see the news section above which is updated most weeks.
