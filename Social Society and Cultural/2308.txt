Arseblog, the arsenal blog• 189 arses Ahhhhh Sunday. I wonder how many Sundays I've had in my life. I'm not a mathematician but I'm 45 1/2 and there's probably a way of working out just how many Sundays I have experienced.
I suppose you would divide years into weeks and weeks into sevens and th...

Arseblog, the arsenal blog• 233 arses Good morning to you, happy Saturday. Let's have a quick round up of all the non-Arsene Wenger related stuff that's going on.
Well, there we go. I hope that was informative and enlightening. The manager and his future is still sharply in focus. At his pr...

Arsecast• 615 arses Man, yesterday seemed like a very long day. I've been doing this blog for coming up on 15 years now, and I don't remember a single day ever having quite so much weight. There was only one thing to talk about and write about of course, and that carries on this ...

Columnists• 7 arses There are few folk heroes more celebrated in football history than the will o’ the wisp number 10. We are familiar with the well-worn stereotype by now. Socks rolled down, shorts pristinely clean well into the final stages of a game, fans and managers alike to...

Arseblog, the arsenal blog• 1035 arses Match report - Player ratings - By the numbers - Video
A second half capitulation in Munich last night called time on our Champions League season. It called time on some of the players involved. And I think it has called time on Arsene Wenger's Arsenal career...

Champions League: Arsenal must keep Bayern tie alive for the second leg
arseblog
February 15, 2017
Arseblog, the arsenal blog• 1513 arses Can we go back in time and let in another goal against Paris Saint-Germain in the group stage so we can play that Barcelona lot? They're rubbish.
A big win for PSG last night shows that cup football can throw up surprises, because as good as the French cham...
Football and the shifting media landscape

Arseblog, the arsenal blog• 439 arses I guess people think being a football journalist is an easy job. I suppose, compared to digging ditches or being a nurse in an overcrowded, underfunded hospital, it probably is.
If you were one who worked their way to a position of writing for a national ne...

A big week ahead as Mesut Ozil comes under increased scrutiny
arseblog
February 13, 2017
Arseblog, the arsenal blog• 230 arses A big week and a strange time lies ahead. A big week because we play Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday night. A strange time because after that it's an FA Cup tie against non-league Sutton United on an artificial pitch, and following that we d...

Arseblog, the arsenal blog• 355 arses Match report - Player ratings - By the numbers - Video
It was cold at the Emirates. Very cold indeed. I can't feel my feet kinda cold, despite two pairs of socks (and a foolish decision on my part to decline the offer of some in-boot foot warmer thingies).
