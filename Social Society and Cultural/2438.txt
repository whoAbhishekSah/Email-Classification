Lewisham Olympic Torch route revealed
Krusty: Put a sock in it, preppy. How much are these free burgers gonna cost me?
Accountant: Not to worry, Mr. K. We've rigged the cards: they're all in
events that Communists never lose.
Krusty: I like, I like.
Woman: This just came over the wires, Big K.
Krusty: [reads] Uh-huh.
Soviet boycott.
U.S. unopposed in most
events.
How does this affect our giveaway?
Accountant: Let's see.
[calculates] You personally stand to lose $44
million.

Olympic orgsnisers have revealed the route the Torch will take through the borough on its way to the Olympic Stadium. In a snub the likes of which we've not seen since the USSR refused to send a team to LA in 1984, the route planners have bypassed Brockley:
Lewisham Route: beginning at 07.21am on the 23rd July 2012
Creekside
Trinity Conservatoire of Music and Dance - Right turn
Creekside -  Left Turn
Creek Road A200 -  Left Turn
Deptford High Street -  Left Turn
Giffin Street - Right Turn
Deptford Church Street (A2209)
Brookmill Road (A2210) - Left Turn
Stephen Lawrence Centre
Forecourt in front of building - Left Turn
Brookmill Road A2210
Thurston Road A2210 - Left Turn
Loampit Vale A20
Lewisham High Street A20 - Right Turn
Lewisham High Street A20
Pedestrianised market area - Right Turn
Lewisham High Street A21
Rushey Green A205
Bromley Road A21
The Torch Relay will reach Lewisham on the morning of Monday 23rd July, before heading onto Bromley, Croydon and Sutton before reaching Merton and then finishing the day in Wandsworth. An average of 115 Torchbearers a day will carry the Olympic Flame during its 8,000 mile journey around the UK before it arrives at the Olympic Stadium on 27 July 2012 for the lighting of the cauldron at the Opening Ceremony, signifying the official start of the Games.
The streets, parks and local landmarks in London through which the Torchbearers will carry the Olympic Flame were revealed today at www.london2012.com/olympictorchrelay , enabling Londoners to plan the best spot to cheer the relay and local businesses to plan ahead. The Torch Relay is set to carry the Olympic atmosphere to every corner of the capital and details for the last two days in London will be confirmed in the next month.
Announcing the London Torch Relay route the Mayor of London Boris Johnson said: “It is fantastic that ordinary Londoners will be an integral part of the Games and help kick-start the most exciting summer in the capital's history, taking the torch past the doorsteps of thousands of people.
“Residents in Lewisham will have a wonderful chance to soak up the festival atmosphere as local people carry the flame towards its final destination at the Olympic Park. Not only will the torch pass by some iconic sights on its travels through the capital, it will visit sports centres, high streets, parks and town halls, bringing the Games right to the heart of London's communities."

I think the torch should go through the refurbished Owl Round About.

Bumped in to the guy in charge of the route on the ELL this evening. Let him know how disappointed the people of Brockley were. He said it didn't go near his house in New Cross either.

Typical Londoners. It's going through every London Borough - including Lewisham High St and Armpit Vale -both within visual range of Brockley - and we complain it's not local enough.Compare to the many more enormous counties of Britiain that it will pop into a corner of briefly.Dishonest fare.

Good luck to them for trying to take the Olympic torch through Deptford without it being nicked.

Does anyone honestly care where it goes?

@who cares? no, not really, but it's a bit of idle info for everyone except Anon 2125, who missed the point.

If Edelman had any influence the route would have gone through Brockley.
If I was your boss there would be a P45 on its way, Nick
- I mean I pay millions a year for this shit and this is what I get?

Myatt Garden Primary School has a connection with the torch as a pupil's father (I think -- if I'm wrong and it was another relative someone will correct me!) was on the design team.

I have always considered this torch bearing thing a bit fascist! First introduced in the 1936 Berlin Olympics and would have been better left there. I did enjoy seeing British bobbies forcing the torch through London four years ago though, on behalf of another repressive regime. Odds are that there will be similar protests at times this year.

It's a shame the world will miss just how much is going on in Brockley, London's most exciting village.

I saw the torch go through my town in California in 2002. Although nothing particularly exciting to see and over quickly, the atmosphere was wonderful and people were happy and excited.That *was* California though...

Oh I don't know. There’s something heart warming about massive indifference and sneering cynicism, I’m cynical about at least three things before breakfast.

How fare is your breakfast, mb? Maybe that's the problem.

I think when you're tasked with carrying a torch around every county in the UK, making the passing time convenient for some nimby in Brockley doesn't really come into it...

"It's not going past my house, I'm too lazy to get out of my pit to walk 20 minutes down the road blah blah blah" Why don't you get up a little earlier grab a coffee and watch a little bit of history no matter how insignificant it is. You love Brockley so much but yet you moan about your neighbours. You live in lewisham, your not that far from reality.

Thought I read that someone was unhappy it wasn't coming to Brockley? Sorry If I got the wrong end of the stick but I'm a bit boozy celebrating Wiggos achievement.
