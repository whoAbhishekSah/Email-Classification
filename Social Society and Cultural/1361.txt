Welcome
AQMeN is a research centre developing dynamic and pioneering projects to improve our understanding of current social issues in the UK and provide policy makers and practitioners with robust, independent, research-based evidence to build a better future. We hope you enjoy this short film about our research into inequalities across crime, education and urban segregation.
In addition to the three research areas below, there are a number of projects underway including Location dynamics, ownership and ethnicity in Scotland, and Scottish and UK Data.
