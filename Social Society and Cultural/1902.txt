Welcome to NOFAS-UK
NOFAS-UK  (The National Organisation for Foetal* Alcohol Syndrome-UK) is dedicated to supporting people affected by Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and their families and communities. It promotes education for professionals and public awareness about the risks of alcohol consumption during pregnancy.  NOFAS-UK is a source for information on FASD to the general public, press and to medical professionals.
NOFAS-UK has been leading the debates in the UK since 2003.  We value diversity and place a high priority on raising the voices of those with FASD, birth mothers, adopters, foster carers, kinship carers and all those who live with and seek to help those with FASD.  We are active in social media on Facebook, Twitter, and as a founding member of the FASD UK Alliance, via the FASD UK Facebook Support Group.
We are here to help.  Please check back frequently for updates on our work, and feel free to share any suggestions you might have as to ways we can further strengthen the community of people seeking change and support.
(* ‘Foetal’ is the British spelling; to search for medical studies and other resources online, use the international medical spelling ‘fetal’.)
