Using the power of sport to change the world for street children
We are Street Child United
We use the power of sport to give street children a voice.
Ahead of the world’s biggest sporting competitions, we organise international sports events for street children raising awareness and changing the way they are negatively seen and treated.
We are the proud organisers of the Street Child World Cup and
Street Child Games.
No child should have to live on the streets.
