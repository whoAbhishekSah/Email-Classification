Lengthy ban for rugby race abuse
Scottish Rugby said there was no room for racism in the sport
A young Borders rugby player has been banned for 28 weeks for racially abusing an opponent.
Hawick YM prop Martin Punter, 19, was suspended from the game until 25 January 2009 by Scottish Rugby's independent disciplinary panel.
It followed complaints that he had verbally abused an opponent during a cup tie against Kirkcaldy on 12 April.
Scottish Rugby's Colin Thomson said they wanted to make it clear there was no room for racism in the sport.
Hawick YM had previously suspended the player from all involvement with the club for a period of 12 weeks.
However, Kirkcaldy decided to cite the player for the abuse directed at their Samoan player-coach Quintan Sanft during the clash in the Borders.
Verbal abuse is contrary to International Rugby Board law 10.4(k) - an act contrary to good sportsmanship.
The recommended IRB sanction for racial abuse is between four and 52 weeks.
