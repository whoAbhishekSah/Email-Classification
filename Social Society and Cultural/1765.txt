New £20 million fund now open to help victims of domestic abuse - Press releases - GOV.UK
This new fund will be used to increase refuge spaces and other accommodation for women fleeing domestic violence.
“Imkaan welcomes the launch of this £20 million fund, which we hope will help to strengthen specialist BME led refuge services. We know from our work with Imkaan members that these critical services have been disproportionately affected by funding cuts, competitive tendering processes and broader challenges. Yet these are often the very organisations that women and children who have experienced violence rely on for safety and support. As such, we welcome the department’s commitment to ensuring that local authorities are resourced to support this vital work. We particularly welcome the commitment to encouraging partnership approaches which acknowledge, and respond to the needs of vulnerable women and children.”Marai Larasi, Executive Director, Imkaan

Sex and Relationships Education in Schools, #SREnow
Imkaan believes that if we are to end violence against women and girls, we need to take steps to prevent it from happening in the first place, and we cannot do this without effective work in schools. Schools provide the best opportunity for us to engage in work with children and young people which addresses everything from equality and respect to masculinity and media messages.We want to see compulsory sex and relationships education (SRE) and we want this to be a Government priority. However, we do not want this to be a quick add-on in our schools. SRE should be part of a broader package of work which ensures that schools are safe environments for all children and young people, and places where learning is not inhibited by sexual and other bullying. If girls are being sexually harassed in our schools, then we are failing to protect them from harm, and we are fostering a culture that disrupts their education.We know from our work at Imkaan, that black and ‘minority ethnic’ girls and young women can be targeted for sexual harassment in ways that are racialised. So we also want SRE to be delivered in ways that are appropriate, effective, and responsive to the realities of young people’s lives. Programmes need to have a clear analysis of gender and other intersecting factor such as ‘race’, sexuality, class and disability. We cannot simply teach respect without recognising the different ways that some groups are disrespected.Marai LarasiExecutive Director, ImkaanCheck out the campaign by End Violence Against Women Coalition and Everyday Sexism ProjectClick here to sign the petition

SURVEY: LEGAL AID FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS IN PRIVATE FAMILY LAW CASES
The Government recently amended, and announced a review of, the evidence requirements for victims of domestic abuse seeking legal aid in private family cases. The Ministry of Justice has now started work with the Law Society, the Legal Aid Practitioners Group, Resolution and Rights of Women to gather more information about the existing arrangements and how they operate in practice.“We have developed a survey to gather the views of legal practitioners and domestic abuse support services on the arrangements, how they work on the ground, and how they might be improved. Your response will be vital in making sure changes to Government regulations are evidence-based and draw on the experiences of those directly supporting victims of domestic abuse and involved in the process of accessing legal aid. We urge you to take the time to complete this survey, which you can access here http://survey.euro.confirmit.com/wix/p1851404231.aspx. Please respond no later than Friday 1st July 2016.
