You can stop this by helping local people to end wars, one person at a time.

Masika is 13.
She lives in DR Congo. Masika was helping her aunt collect firewood when she was captured by soldiers and forced to join the militia.
She was forced to live a life no child should live.
Thankfully, she was found by our local partner. They gave her food, shelter and psychological support.
They will find her family, or a foster home to take care of her, and provide skills training or support her to go back to school.
Local people stopping war and building peace were a lifeline to Masika.
They urgently need your support.

Your impact
Your donation helps child-soldiers to live - not just survive - when they return home.
It trains young people to turn away from violent extremism, so they can teach others to do the same.
And it creates jobs to rebuild livelihoods after war has torn communities apart.
