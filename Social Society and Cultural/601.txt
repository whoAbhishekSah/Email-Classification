Welcome to Island Life
the leading community and
portal site in the Channel Islands
Launched in December
2000 and celebrating our fourteenth anniversary
this year, we are the leading community site and
portal in the Channel islands with visitors from all over the World, particularly those with
Channel Island connections.
Use the navigation buttons on the
left to first choose the home page of each island and then move to the sub menus for
further pages covering all aspects of island life.
The navigation buttons at the top are more general subjects, not specific to any particular
island. The navigation line at the top of each
page shows where you are in the website. Visit our
Blogs
The site is unique in that it brings together
information about all the Channel Islands for residents and tourists
alike. We welcome contributors from
all the islands to help keep the content up to date, particularly in the Community sections
and are always pleased to receive articles
and photography. The latest article by Gillian Mawson describes
the experiences of some of the 20,000 Channel Islanders evacuated to the North of England in
June 1940. She will be writing a daily diary of the experiences of one evacuee Pamela
Dorey. Click here
Businesses listed on the site gain
valuable exposure to island residents and indeed people all over the
World. Contact
us for details of our cost effective
advertising rates. Clubs, Associations and Charities can also make use of free web space by
emailing details to be included on their own web page at Island
Life.
