Ginette's Orange Gate Journal
Orange Gate Journal
A Personal View of the Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp
By Ginette Leach
From November 1982 to January 1985, Ginette was visitor and then regular member of the women's community at Orange Gate, part of the Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp.
Orange Gate was one of several gates – all with women's peace camps – that surrounded the RAF Greenham Common air base and infuriated officialdom. American cruise missile nuclear weapons were deployed at RAF Greenham Common in 1983.
Ginette's Orange Gate Journal is a personal, and often very funny perspective, that was written within hours of it happening.
