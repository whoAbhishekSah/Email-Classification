Bhaktivedanta Manor is the largest UK centre of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). Bhaktivedanta Manor propagates the teachings of
the authentic Vedic scriptures. These were finally brought to the West by Srila Prabhupada, Bhaktivedanta Manor´s founder. George Harrison of The Beatles kindly donated
Bhaktivedanta Manor to ISKCON in 1973 to cater for the growing congregation. Today Bhaktivedanta Manor has developed into an important theological college, and has become renowned as a place of pilgrimage. It is a holy place dedicated to the upliftment of human society through spiritual education, culture and lifestyle. This rural retreat serves as a window to Vrindavan, Lord Krishna´s eternal home. It is a God-centred community which gives refuge to people from all walks of life.
