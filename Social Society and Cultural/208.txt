September 27, 2013
Leave a comment
The Department for Education has published Planned Expenditure on Schools, Education, Children and Young People’s Services by local authorities: financial year 2013 to 2014. The Statistical Release provides a summary of the planned expenditure from all 152 Local Authorities (returned to the Department for Education (DfE) via the ‘Section 251 Budget Return’). It shows that spending on ‘Total Services for Young People’ is planned to fall from £664m in 2012/13 to £636m in 2013/14. Within the ‘Total Services for Young People’ category, there will be a slight increase in Targeted Services (from £277 million to £306 million) but a larger fall in Universal Services from (from £386 million to £329 million). Unlike in previous years, there is no separate category of ‘Youth work’.

Government funding for voluntary and community programmes

The Department for Education has published details of its VCSE National Prospectus grants. 72 applications secured funding for 2013-15, worth just over £50m in total over the next two years, to implement projects and services to improve outcomes for children, young people and families.
Communities Minister Don Foster has announced up to £1 million to support single homeless people. Foster allocated up to £800,000 for homelessness charity Crisis to fund schemes to set up new shared tenancies for single homeless people in privately rented accommodation. He also announced a further £230,000 for the charity to continue its Private Rented Sector Access Programme, which works with local landlords to help vulnerable people find the homes they need in privately rented accommodation.
The Department for Culture Media and Sport has announced the winner of £1.8m of National Lottery and Sport England funding focused on changing the sporting habits of women and girls. The funding was won by Bury, who will now pilot a scheme that will evolve based on local feedback.

Voluntary and community sector funding
May 17, 2013

Figures from the Department for Communities and Local Government given in answering a written parliamentary question suggest that the value of grants given by local authorities to voluntary sector organisations were £2.627bn in 2011/12 compared with £1.693bn in 2008/09. In response NAVCA said no one really believed local government funding for charities was rising and suggested that ‘changes in the way figures are calculated may have caused this odd figure’.
NCVO has published Counting the Cuts: The impact of spending cuts on the UK voluntary and community sector -2013 update. This analysis, based on Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts of public spending, estimates that public funding for charities could be £1.7bn (12%) lower by 2017/18. It noted that future reductions in public spending are likely to be concentrated among departments which are key sources of income for charities – with local government expected to be particularly hard hit.
NCVO has also published the results of the 2011/12 Annual Return for Volunteer Centres, a survey of volunteer centres’ income and activities. It shows that 40% of volunteer centres for whom there is data for both years lost over a quarter of their income compared to the previous year. 1 in 5 (21%) had cuts of 50% or more of their income. A smaller number of volunteer centres saw an increase in their income – 26% of respondents who replied to the survey in both years said their organisation’s income had increased compared to 2010/11.
NAVCA has published the findings of its fourth quarterly survey of members. The latest survey shows that more members feel that the prospects for the local voluntary and community sector will get slightly worse over the next three months, with nearly half reducing staff levels.

Further education

A TES article has said that the Association of Employment and Learning Providers (AELP) has been contacted by a number of the FE providers in their membership about their allocations from the Education Funding Agency (EFA) being at least 20-30 per cent lower than anticipated. “The AELP has warned that the confusion, which has led to some providers being told that they will receive more than £1 million less than expected for 2013-14, could jeopardise the raising of the participation age to 17 this summer in some areas.” The Department for Education is in the process of changing 16-19 funding, which will result in institutions being funded per learner rather than by qualification.
