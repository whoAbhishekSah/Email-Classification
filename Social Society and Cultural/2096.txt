Surrogacy UK
Welcome to Surrogacy UK!
A very warm welcome to Surrogacy UK, the leading UK not-for-profit surrogacy organisation.
Our ethos is “surrogacy through friendship”.  Through our organisation, Surrogates and Intended Parents can meet one another and form the friendships that can lead to dreams coming true.  We are here to help and support you through all the stages of your surrogacy journey.
Our website tells you all you need to know about surrogacy, how our organisation works, and how to become a member.  The website also hosts our online message-boards, a buzzing online community where you’ll find friendship, advice, and support.
You’ll find some terms used throughout this website:
