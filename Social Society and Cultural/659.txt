NOW UPDATED WITH LATEST FIGURES FROM THE 2011 CENSUS
UK Civic Pride
This website provides those
Key Facts
about UK Towns and
Cities which help to instill civic pride amongst their citizens.  These
include details of towns with the civic honours of
city status and/or a
lord mayoralty or those which  have a
university or a cathedral. Other factors
which boost civic pride  include having a good
football team or winning the
national
Britain in Bloom competition, and this website will show which towns
and cities have been the most successful. Finally being connected with famous
people or having a sizeable population can also contribute to a sense of civic
pride, and the latest census
population figures for all towns over 100,000 are
included.
To find information about a specific UK
town or city look at the Towns
& Cities page. All information has been thoroughly checked to make sure it is authentic,
valid and reliable. Check the Reference
Sources page for more details. If you would like an organisation listed or wish to advertise on this site
