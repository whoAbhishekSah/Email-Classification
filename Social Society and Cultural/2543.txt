Does this page style look too bland to you? Many of the
proof-of-concept and
publicity demo websites I have made at work contain not just graphics,
movement
and interaction but even interaction with peripherals such as radio tag
readers, video switches and room lighting controls! However the purpose
of this
site is to provide useful and entertaining information so I
have
deliberately put no unnecessary graphics or gimmicks on this site
(other than
artworks where the graphics and gimmicks are the core material), just
information. This is unlike the plethora of highly decorative but
tedious to
navigate commercial sites and garbage filled personal pages that are so
fashionable thesedays.
If you have any comments, or if you want to be notified of
updates to this
site, contact me.
