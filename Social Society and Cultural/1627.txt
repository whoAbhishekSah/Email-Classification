For some years, Dewar Research has been producing studies of social
policy, particularly with regard to Domestic Violence. This website
is a new channel to make more widely available some of that study
material.
Dewar Research seeks to provide information generally on the issue
of Domestic Violence, in particular on the victimisation of men
in domestic relationships and the nature and prevalence of abuse
by female partners.
This Information Resource is provided for:- academics and
students seeking to research the subject, journalists who write on
the issue, and any other interested individuals who wish to learn
more about this often hidden social problem.
