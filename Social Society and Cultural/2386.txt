If you are interested in invigorating walks through the stunning countryside
surrounding London, with a friendly bunch of people from all walks of life,
then this is the group for you.
Blackheath Ramblers strike out in all weathers
and conditions, through frosted forests and muddy fields, into sun-dappled woods
carpeted with bluebells and wild garlic, across wind-swept ridges and over
sun-drenched downs, visiting medieval churches and picturesque villages along the way.
Our
walks programme is extremely varied and takes us to all the counties around
London, with a particular focus on Kent, Surrey and Sussex. We endeavour to offer
a walk every Saturday and Sunday and Bank Holidays.
Most of our walks are over
10 miles, ranging from 11-16 miles in the winter to 11-20 miles in the summer.
Our pace varies from moderate to brisk.
We always start from a railway station,
and always have an hour’s lunch break, with a country pub being a central feature
of our day.
In the summer months, some leaders also incorporate a tea break into
their walk at a village tea shop, because we enjoy the social aspect of walking
as well as the challenge of an energetic
ramble in the country.
We also now offer a regular programme of at least monthly
shorter walks,
generally between 3-5 miles, at an easy pace, most of which are urban walks
in Lewisham or Greenwich or nearby parts of London. Everyone is welcome to
join these walks. You can view the current programme
here.
Don’t
hesitate to join us if you live outside the Blackheath area: we have
members who come from all parts of London and surrounding counties, attracted
by the length of walk which our group consistently offers.
