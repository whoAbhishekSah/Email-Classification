G-DASH : UK BALLOON REGISTER
Welcome to the UK Balloon Register g-dash.co.uk.  This website details most of the balloons to appear on the UK civil aircraft register. I have tried to make these pages simpler to search
than the old site, hopefully you agree.  I am still missing quite a few UK balloons so if you have any photos of balloons not featured in these pages please get in touch, i'd love to add them to
the site.
Recently, i have decided to introduce a "Non-UK" section to the site.  These additional pages are not intended to be definitive listings of balloons from the rest of the world, they are just
examples of some of the balloons i've been lucky enough to see on my travels.
My thanks must go to the many photographers, enthusiasts and owners who have contributed photographs to the site, without you this would not have been possible.  All photos on this site are
copyright G Bann or of the various photographers listed and should not be used without prior permission in writing from me.
To give me an idea of who's been visiting me here or if you just want to tell me what you think of the site, please leave me a message in the guestbook.
Please dont try and sell me services or tell me you can "improve my position in the google rankings" for a fee as i am not interested and those messages are reported as spam.
This site is dedicated to the memory of Michael Clarke, who contributed so many photographs to these pages.
NEWS:
Over 3000 photos of UK registered balloons on the site!
