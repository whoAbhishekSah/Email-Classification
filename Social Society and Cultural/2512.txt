Welcome to the website of Craig Gibbons International Swimmer.
Having been in swimming for nearly 17 years I have come to realise the importance of happy swimmers, after all a happy swimmer equals a fast swimmer and I am sure every top level swimmer will tell you the same!
For this reason I have set-up this website to provide younger swimmers with the fun, focus and determination they need to achieve their goals, be it achieving a personal best time, winning a race or becoming a national champion in the future.Craig was a proud member of Team GB at London 2012
