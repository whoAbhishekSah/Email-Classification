The London Saxophone Choir, formed in February 2008, is a group of enthusiastic Saxophone players who rehearse most weeks within walking distance of Pimlico and Victoria Stations. We have an inclusive membership policy (no auditions) and draw members from all walks of life and from across London. We play specially arranged music in a variety of styles; baroque, classical, modern(ish) and jazz and give formal concerts from time to time as well as playing on numerous bandstands in the Summer, switching to carol concerts in the Winter. Our core instrumentation includes soprano, alto, tenor and baritone saxes with sopranino and bass added from time to time.
