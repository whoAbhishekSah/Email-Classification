What you’ll find here
This site is intended for use as a resource, and is an ongoing project – future updates will be announced in News. It includes a selection of my published and unpublished articles and talks from the 1970s to the present. These are listed under All articles in chronological order of publication. You can also find articles on the relevant topic pages (links in Menu) or use the search box. If you are interested in something I’ve written that doesn’t appear here, please let me know and I will try to help.
The Links and resources section includes links to groups, activists and researchers in related areas. I am gradually adding other resource materials such as interviews and background articles gathered during my research.
