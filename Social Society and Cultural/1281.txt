Her Majesty The Queen, accompanied by The Duke of Edinburgh, will mark the year of The Queen’s Diamond Jubilee with a visit to north Northamptonshire.
Touring the country by road, rail, air and sea, The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh will travel widely across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Queen will visit Corby during a tour of the east midlands on Wednesday and Thursday, June 13 and 14.
A statement on the Royal Family’s website said: “These visits will give Her Majesty the opportunity to express her thanks to people throughout the country for their continued support and loyalty.”
