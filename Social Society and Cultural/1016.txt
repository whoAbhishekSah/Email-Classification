Classic Cafes | London's vintage Formica caffs!
:www.classiccafes.co.uki | The
Very Best of London's Vintage Formica Caffs |
iUpdated: Mar 10 2010
Often dismissed as 'greasy spoons', Classic Cafes
are actually little gems of British vernacular high street design.
This site celebrates their ambience and architecture with over
130 vintage London Formica caffs (and many others around Britain)
reviewed, revealed & reappraised. But as Time Out Restaurant
Guide noted, the site isn't simply: "a
set of recommendations... it's a whole aesthetic!"; an immersive
re-exploration of a cultural phenomenon that is fading all too
fast. The Classic Cafes Book -- now long out of print -- has been acclaimed
by the Royal Institute of British Architects as 'sumptuous... beautiful... breathtaking...
deeply evocative...', and praised by the Twentieth
Century Society as a work of 'genius... passionate... elegiac... '.
