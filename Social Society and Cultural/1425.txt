Kerr complains of race hate mail
Brian Kerr lost the Republic of Ireland job in October
Brian Kerr has said that he received racist hate mail during his time in charge of the Republic of Ireland.
"I had to put up with a series of fairly vile abusive letters," said the former Irish boss.
"That was because I had Chris Hughton, a very Irish black man on the staff, and I had black players in the team, like Clinton Morrison and Steven Reid."
Kerr lost the Republic job in October after the team's failure to qualify for the World Cup finals.
The former Irish boss made the revelation ahead of the launch of the Brian Kerr Intercontinental League, a six-week tournament involving teams from Ireland's ethnic communities and organised by Sport Against Racism in Ireland.
"It was the first time I've really come across it up front and up close to me," he said.
"It was vile stuff, but it was sad really, and it just shows you that there's some twisted minds around the place.
"The letters came from different sources, but names and addresses were scarce, as you can imagine. I passed that stuff onto the Guards (police).
I hope they have success in the future
Brian Kerr on the new Republic managerial team
"It just shows you the mentality that can be around the place, instead of seeing the gifts these players and coaches had and how they had done a fantastic job and will continue to.
"They're as Irish as Irish can be. It emphasised for me how narrow-minded people can be, but also the responsibility of people in sport to rid ourselves of that type of thinking."
Kerr wished his successor Steve Staunton "every success" in the Republic role.
With former England manager Sir Bobby Robson serving as advisor, Kerr added: "There's an interesting group of people now running the team.
"Steve has been an exceptional player for Ireland in the past and he's brought in other people that have experience of management and so on.
"Like anyone who has a real passion for Irish football, a real love for it and who wants success for us in sport, I hope they have success in the future and good luck to them with it."
Kerr has applied for the position of the South African football manager but says he has had "no personal contact" with
the South African Football Association."
