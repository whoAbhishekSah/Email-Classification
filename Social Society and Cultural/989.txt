The Emma Humphreys Memorial Prize
Cath Elliott
Posted on October 26, 2015
I was hugely honoured yesterday to be one of two women awarded the Emma Humphreys individual prize, which this year was focused on “women who have challenged male violence against women through their writing.” The amazing Gabriella Gillsepie also won, and I’m thrilled to be joint winner with such an inspiring woman.
I think yesterday was one of those days I’m never going to forget: I felt humbled and really quite overwhelmed by it all by the time I finally staggered into bed last night. Highlights of the day for me were sharing the stage with the other shortlisted candidates, and the fantastic reception we received from the crowd at the Feminism in London Conference where the awards ceremony took place.
But do you know what also really got to me? Logging onto Twitter and Facebook this morning and seeing all the lovely supportive messages from people. In fact there was a point earlier today when I was going through my notifications and thanking everyone (my apologies if there’s anyone I missed) when I wanted to tweet “ok, you can stop all this niceness now, this is Twitter don’t forget and that’s not how we do things on here!”
Because it’s not really is it, not anymore. For a lot of people social media isn’t about being nice, or being supportive, or showing solidarity with a group or a cause; it’s about snarking, and policing people’s language, pulling someone up for the slightest ideological misdemeanour, or putting them down for some other, usually minor, infraction.
But whatever, that’s an issue for another post on another day: certainly not one for today. Because today people are being nice to me on social media, and I’m going to try and enjoy it while it lasts.

Let’s #voteCorbyn to improve women’s representation. Erm what?
Cath Elliott
Posted on August 18, 2015
Since Jeremy Corbyn threw his hat into the ring I’ve seen a number of people claiming with no sense of irony at all that ‘as feminists‘ they’re proud to be supporting him in his campaign to be the next leader of the Labour Party. Personally I haven’t decided who I’m voting for yet: as a socialist I may well end up voting for Corbyn myself, but I’m certainly under no illusion that that would be the feminist thing to do.
It’s not often I find myself agreeing with a Telegraph journalist, let alone former Labour Party official and ultra Blairite Dan Hodges, but much like a stopped clock it seems even Hodges manages to get it right sometimes. A few weeks ago for example I watched the following exchange unfold on Twitter, and while I didn’t join in, I did find myself cheering Hodges along from the sidelines:

More about marital rape
Cath Elliott
Posted on July 27, 2015
When I first started writing about marital rape back in 2009 I couldn’t have anticipated that it would become one of the key issues to bring people to this blog. But it is, and so I’ve got into a bit of a cycle now. The more I post about marital rape for instance the more likely it is that this blog becomes a landing place for people searching for information about it, and the more people who land here having searched for information about marital rape, the more I get to see the search terms people are using for it, and the more I get to see of those the more likely I am to write about the subject again, and on and on it goes.

Vote chasing and selling out…….
Cath Elliott
Posted on July 13, 2015
I’m relieved to see there’s now a bit of a backlash following Harriet Harman’s pronouncement yesterday that the Labour Party will not be opposing the Tory government’s welfare cuts. According to Harman, the current interim leader of the party, Labour won’t be voting against the proposed welfare bill and its MPs shouldn’t even think about opposing the Tory plan to limit child tax credits to two children.
Harman’s bizarre rationale is that because the Tories won the election, opposing their policies would be some kind of affront to the voting public: that by doing what any self-respecting left wing opposition party should be doing and standing up for working people, the poor and the vulnerable, and (god forbid) for some socialist principles, Labour would essentially be telling the voters they got the election all wrong.
Apart from the moral bankruptcy of this argument, what’s tragic about this line of thinking is that if we take it to it’s natural conclusion we’re left with a Labour ‘opposition’ in Parliament that opposes nothing; a ‘left wing’ alternative that simply rubber stamps every Tory proposal that comes along. And ultimately, if Harman and some of her acolytes get their way, we’re also left with a party so busy chasing votes and trying to win elections for the sake of winning elections, it has no policies or principles left to speak of and is indistinguishable from the very party it’s trying to defeat.

Is another attack on abortion rights in the offing?
Cath Elliott
Posted on June 3, 2015
I was watching the Parliament channel yesterday afternoon when I noticed the following little gem from Conservative MP Anne Main.
Main was responding to the Labour MP Angela Rayner’s maiden speech in the House of Commons, where Rayner had mentioned, as part of a spirited defence of the National Health Service, that one of her sons had been born at 23 weeks and owed his life to our NHS.
Anne Main:
“I congratulate the hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Angela Rayner) on her maiden speech. It was a very thought-provoking speech and one thing I will take from it was her passionate wishes for her young son, who she said survived at 23 weeks’ gestation. I wish her well in that and some of my right hon. and hon. Friends and some Opposition Members who tried in the last Parliament to revisit the gestational age for abortion may well wish to remind her of that if she is present for any such debate. I would like that subject to be revisited at some point in the future, as I know would other colleagues.”
I know there was nothing in either the Tory Party manifesto or the Queen’s Speech about revisiting the debate on the abortion term-limits, but it doesn’t look as though this issue is going to go away anytime soon either.
Main’s comments are also a reminder, if any such reminder was needed, that some (snidey) people never miss an opportunity….
You can find the full Hansard text of the exchange here – Hansard. 2nd June 2015
