Poverty indicators - The Poverty Site
The Poverty Site
The UK site for statistics on poverty and social exclusion.
Due to the retirement of its webmaster, this
website is no longer being updated. The last updates were in late
2011.  Apologies for any inconvenience.
This site monitors what is happening to poverty and social exclusion in the UK.
The material is organised around 100
statistical indicators covering all aspects of the subject, from income and work to health and education.
The indicators and graphs can be viewed by age group or by subject using the menu on the left.
The material covers all parts of the United Kingdom, with specific sections for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
All data is from official sources and is the latest available.
All graphs and text are updated whenever new data becomes available.
