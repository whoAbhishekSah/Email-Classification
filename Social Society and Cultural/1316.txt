ListenDiamond Jubilee debate in Parliament20/03/2012 First Minister Alex Salmond has welcomed the announcement that a debate will be held in the Scottish Parliament to mark the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee year.
The news comes on the day the Queen addressed both Houses of Parliament in London to mark her 60 years on the throne.
The First Minister said:
“During her reign of 60 years, the Queen has been a firm friend of Scotland and, in May, I will be delighted to lead a debate in the Scottish Parliament to mark this Diamond Jubilee.
“The Queen’s affection for this nation is reciprocated by Scots of all generations and the official Diamond Jubilee celebrations in June will therefore be a major celebration here in Scotland.
"I am particularly looking forward to welcoming Her Majesty to Glasgow in 2014, when the city hosts the Commonwealth Games. It is absolutely fitting that her hard work and dedication through the years be celebrated by all of us, both in Scotland and across the wider Commonwealth.”
