The Strategic ICT Toolkit Project (SICT) is a self-analysis toolkit to help higher education institutions (HEIs) to analyse, assess and develop their strategic use of information technologies.
Developed by The University of Nottingham, this toolkit supports senior management in HE in developing towards more strategically directed ICT deployment. This project drew on the experience, insights and existing practices of a representative sample of HEIs to develop a toolkit to stimulate their understanding and support institutional development. This project was commissioned by The Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) and the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education (LFHE).
