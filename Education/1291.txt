SubSift
SubSift, short for submission sifting, matches submitted conference or journal papers to potential peer reviewers based on similarity to published works.
Conference organisers and journal editors can use the interactive SubSift demonstrations on this site to help support their academic peer review process.
SubSift for Developers
Developers can incorporate SubSift's functionality into their own applications using the web services hosted on this site as a research community resource. SubSift web services can be used individually or composed into workflows, such as the original submission sifting workflow depicted is the schematic below.
The SubSift software is open source and freely available. If our publicly hosted SubSift web services are not appropriate for your particular application then the software is available as a download on Google Code.
