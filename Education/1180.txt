FIND DATA OUR PROJECTSSKOS-HASSET / OVERVIEWOVERVIEWPROJECT OUTPUTSKEEP IN TOUCHThis project, funded under the JISC Research Tools Programme, will apply the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) to the Humanities and Social Science Electronic Thesaurus (HASSET), and test its automatic indexing properties.
The objective of this project is to apply Resource
Description Framework (RDF) to HASSET, the UK Data Archive's
leading and well-respected English language social science
thesaurus.
Its aims are threefold: firstly, it will apply SKOS to HASSET,
thus creating SKOS-HASSET; secondly, it will test SKOS-HASSET's
automatic indexing capabilities in relation to survey data
resources; thirdly, it will improve the Archive's thesaurus online
presence, by enhancing the existing management interface, the
user-facing pages and all the Archive's underlying thesaurus
database tables and structure.
It will provide not only a SKOS-enabled product for use within
the social science information and research communities, but also
advice and recommendations on how the terms within this product can
be applied automatically to text.
Once created, SKOS-HASSET will be taken as the terminology
source for an automatic indexing parser and applied to question
text, abstracts and publications from the Archive's collection. The
results will be compared to the gold standard of humanly-undertaken
indexing, and shared.
Licensing issues for the product will be addressed to ensure the
widest possible accessibility. A user forum will be set up to
encourage pooling of knowledge around this high quality and robust
tool. User engagement will be paramount, with the wider user
community being contacted from early on in the life of the
project.
The timing of this project is ideal as it follows on directly
from the Archive's review of its thesauri and will help to take
forward their development.
Dates: 1 June 2012 - 31 January 2013
