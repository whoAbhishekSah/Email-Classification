This version adds 'Like' and 'Send' buttons to the app which allows a user to share the app with their friends. For those not familiar with Facebook, the Like button is one of its key features. When a user clicks on the Like button it adds a 'story' (a link to the app plus a logo, a title and a short description) to their wall/timeline and also allows them to add an associated message or comment. T...hat Like story will then appear on each of their friends' News Feeds ("John likes the Course Search app") with a link back to the page/app. When John's friends see the Like story they can click it to see the app and Like or comment on it themselves, which then gets shared with all their friends, and so on, and so on.
The Send button works in a similar way to Like but allows a user to easily send content to specific friends directly. They have the option to send a 'story' to their Facebook friends, to a Facebook Group wall and/or as an email to any email address. Where the Like button allows a user to share content with all their friends, the Send button allows them to send a private message to just a few friends. This iteration also sees the final 'development' version of the app. We will shortly be contacting institutions to trial the app with a view to making it available to all by the end of March 2013. अधिक देखेंXCRI-CAP Course Search AppAn XCRI-CAP based Facebook Course Search app.सभी देखेंपोस्टXCRI-CAP Course Search App ने अपना एल्बम साझा किया. · 11 नवंबर 2012 · Following on from an earlier posting, I've now posted a set of images showing some examples of the analytics information that's captured for the XCRI-CAP Facebook Course Search app. The app uses standard Google Analytics page and event tracking so any/all of the Google Analytics tools can be used to query and report on the data.+4XCRI-CAP Course Search App ने एल्बम में 7 नई फ़ोटो को जोड़ा: Example Analytics reporting. · 11 नवंबर 2012 · +4XCRI-CAP Course Search App · 9 नवंबर 2012 · The next iteration of the app is now available on the project's Facebook page. This version adds analytics tracking for the events within the app, for example searching for a keyword or viewing a course. This will allow the owners/administrators of the app (ie. the Institutions) to monitor things like what keywords are being searched for, which courses are looked at the most, how users click through to the institutions own website, etc. Once the app has had time to gather some analytics data I’ll post some examples showing the kind of reports that can created.XCRI-CAP Course Search AppAn XCRI-CAP based Facebook Course Search app.XCRI-CAP Course Search App · 19 अक्टूबर 2012 · The next iteration of the app is now available on the project's Facebook page. This version adds a second instance of the app for a different provider (the OU) to demonstrate some of the customisation. Each version is styled according to the format/layout of the provider’s website, and the OU feed contains more data so has more functionality enabled of the Course Details page. Please note, the OU data feed currently in use is old/test data and does not necessarily relate to c...urrent OU content. Following on from an observation in my previous post, I've also done some more investigation into the level of data coming out of the aggregator. I'm happy to report that after testing some more 'densely populated' test feeds, the aggregator does seem to be serving up all the data it harvests from a feed. The issue appears to be with the level of data currently going into the feeds, possibly due to many of the feeds still being work in progress? अधिक देखेंXCRI-CAP Course Search AppAn XCRI-CAP based Facebook Course Search app.XCRI-CAP Course Search App · 15 अक्टूबर 2012 · The next iteration of the app is now available on the project's Facebook page. This version adds a new screen to view course details from within the app. The course details page also includes a) a link to the institutions own course details page, and b) a link to the institution's Apply To page to allow application directly from the app. Both links are obviously dependent upon the relevant URL data being included in the institutions XCRI-CAP feed. If the either URL data item ...isn't present then the relevant link will be hidden. Following on from earlier blog entries, the work on the course details page has raised a couple of new observations. 1. Inconsistencies with the implementation of the XCRI-CAP standard between providers. This takes the form of a) what data is provided in feeds, and b) which XCRI-CAP fields the data is put in (eg. in some cases applyTo contains a URL and in others it contains an email address/phone number). These inconsistencies have had two impacts on development. The first is to affect the reliability/suitability of fields as search parameters, eg. standard/mandatory fields which we planned to use as parameters in the search aren't really appropriate. The second is to reduce the 'standard functionality' which can be built into an app, ie. the course details page needs to be tweaked for each provider's data individually. 2. Not much detailed course data is coming out of the aggregator (ie. the coverage of data items/fields). I don't know yet if this is because there's not much going in (ie. sparsely populated feeds), or if data is getting filtered on output somehow. I will report further findings in a subsequent blog posting. 3. A very minor observation is that the JSON feed out of the aggregator uses different terms for data items than the XCRI-CAP standard, eg. 'qual.type' instead of 'qualification.abbr' or 'credits.val' instead of 'credit.value'. It's fairly easy to tell from the JSON/data what's what so it isn't really an issue from a development perspective. I only raise it as it may be something the programme wants to consider in terms of data standards? अधिक देखेंXCRI-CAP Course Search AppAn XCRI-CAP based Facebook Course Search app.XCRI-CAP Course Search App · 20 सितंबर 2012 · The next iteration of the app is now available on the project's Facebook page. This version adds paging forward/backwards through the search results. We were aiming to include a screen to view course details within the app too. Our investigations into the XCRI-CAP data that is currently available though hass shown some inconsistencies in how and were data is being populated in the XCRI-CAP schema. We've therefore rescheduled the details page for a later iteration whilst we id...entify consistent data and/or an more flexible way of coping with it. We've also encountered a potential issue with the Aggregator (Issue #66 on GitHub). We’re using the aggregator’s ElasticSearch interface to select courses for a specific institution. We therefore need a persistent way of selecting just that institution's courses (ie. something that can be built into the app). We’re currently using the provid and had assumed that it was created when an institution registers on the feed manager and would therefore be persistant. However, following the Aggregator being rebooted, we noticed that all the provids changed. I’ve raised it with Ian at K-Int who confirmed that the provids aren’t permanent and will be recreated whenever the aggregator is bounced. Ian also made the suggestion should be discussed with the community before a fix is implemented. We’re currently progressing on the assumption that the provid (or an equivalent) will become a persistent ID so this isn't holding up development. अधिक देखेंXCRI-CAP Course Search AppAn XCRI-CAP based Facebook Course Search app.XCRI-CAP Course Search App · 5 सितंबर 2012 ·
· The first 'bare bones' iteration of the app is now available on the project's Facebook page. This is an early proof of concept to check we can install the app as a Facebook PageTab and communicate with the Aggregator. The next iteration will add functionality for paging through results and viewing course details within the app. Also, we've identified some willing(?) volunteers as some of the Stage 2 institutions who have kindly agreed to help us review and test the app.XCRI-CAP Course Search AppAn XCRI-CAP based Facebook Course Search app.XCRI-CAP Course Search App · 20 अगस्त 2012 · XCRI-CAP Facebook Course Search app, what's it all about? For those not familiar with XCRI-CAP, it's a standard format for the electronic exchange of course data (for example description, location, duration, cost, qualification, etc). It helps institutions meet the increasing demand for live course data by promoting:
- efficient collection by aggregator and broker agencies
- systematic comparison of learning opportunities...
- new integrated information, advice and guidance services. Facebook needs little introduction. It's one of the most widely used social networks in the world with around 30 million users in the UK and 800 million worldwide. This provides a significant audience for course advertising. This project will develop an XCRI-CAP based Facebook course search app. It will allow an institution to brand the 'white labelled' app, point it at their XCRI-CAP feed and install it on their Facebook page. Students will then be able to use the app to search, view and click through to apply for courses from within Facebook. Using Facebook's inherent social networking features will also allow institutions to leverage students' own social networks as a multiplier for their site/courses. Also, using a Facebook app will give institutions the potential to use Facebook Ad and marketing tools to publicise courses (with the ability to select quite specific target audiences). So now you know, that's what it’s all about. अधिक देखेंXCRI-CAP Course Search App · 6 अगस्त 2012 · Today we held the Project Start up meeting with JISC’s Rob Englebright, so the project is now officially up and running! JISC selected the project as an XCRI-CAP demonstrator under the Course Data: making the most of course information programme. Over the next few months we’ll be developing an XCRI-CAP based Facebook Course Search app. Institutions will be able to brand the app and install it on their Facebook page. Students will then be able to use the app to search and retrieve the institution’s course data from the JISC aggregator and view or apply for courses through Facebook.Course Data: making the most of course informationjisc.ac.ukऔर देखें
