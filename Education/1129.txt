Research Information Network
A decade after we first started at the British Library, and four years since we established ourselves as an independent Community Interest Company, the Research Information Network (RIN) wound itself up at the end of December 2015.
It’s been a great time for all of us involved in the RIN, and we like to think we’ve made some important contributions to changing policy and practice in many areas of scholarly communications. The three of us who worked at RIN – Michael Jubb, Stéphane Goldstein and Ellen Collins – are pursuing new opportunities in the various areas of scholarly and research communications, and information literacy, in which we have built up expertise.
The RIN website has now been wound up. A few key pages, covering our activities from 2012 to 2015, are now hosted by the Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU), with which we have enjoyed a close relationship over the years. Our earlier website, relating to the period 2005 to 2011, has been archived by the British Library, and can be found here. This includes all our reports published during that time.
