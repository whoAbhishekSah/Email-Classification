Founder,
the late Eddie Leece
The Leece
Museum is devoted to objects, photographs
and documents specifically relating to Peel
in the Isle of Man.
Our archive of unique documents and photographs is of particular
interest to those who are researching family history, as well
as to visitors with a general interest in the life of a busy
Manx fishing port in days gone by.
The Leece Museum was established in 1984 by Eddie Leece, a retired headmaster of Peel Clothworkers School,
and former Town Commissioner, and Frank Quayle who served as
the museum's curator for its first 15 years.
In 2015 we created a permanent exhibition of TT & MGP winning racing
machines, vintage, and
off-road bikes. All housed in the Black Hole
Prison cell where wrong doers we incarcerated in days gone by. There are still
some reminders of those days in the cell, chains on the walls, when prison was
for the simplest of offence.
The dedicated staff of the museum bring a wealth
of experience and local knowledge from which visitors can benefit.
In addition, due to our close relationship with other research
groups, we can usually assist in research and educational projects
covering a wide variety of themes from natural history to industrial
archaeology and architecture.
You can find us a short
distance from the House
of Manannan, overlooking the picturesque working harbour
and Peel Castle.
The Leece Museum is
keen to continue developing its collection of artefacts and
documents relating to Peel life, either by loan or donation.
We can copy documents and photographs to store as computer
archives and will return the originals, if required.
The Museum also has tourist
information for Peel.
There is also a Tourist Information Point at the Town
Hall, Derby Road,
open weekdays only.
