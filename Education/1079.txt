RDMRose
RDMRose was a JISC funded project to produce taught and continuing professional development (CPD) learning materials in Research Data Management (RDM) tailored for Information professionals.
RDMRose developed and adapted learning materials about RDM to meet the specific needs of liaison librarians in university libraries, both for practitioners’ CPD and for embedding into the postgraduate taught (PGT) curriculum. Its deliverables included OER materials suitable for learning in multiple modes, including face to face and self-directed learning.
RDMRose brought together the UK’s leading iSchool with a practitioner community based on the White Rose University Consortium’s libraries at the Universities of Leeds, Sheffield and York. Development of content and teaching was iterative, based on a highly participative curriculum development process and with a strong strand of student evaluation of learning materials and activities.
Deliverables included: OER on RDM for information professionals which can be reused by other LIS educators and with a version for self-supported Continuing Professional Development.
As of April 2015 a new version of the learning materials is now available - click on RDMRose 2015 tab!
Slides from the 2015 version are also available on slideshare.
The project was funded by JISC for one year from July 2012 to June 2013.
In 2014, we conducted RDMRose's sister project Wicked ways with RDM.
Project director: Andrew Cox; Research associates: Eddy Verbaan and Jen Smith.
