Developments in ePortfolios enable greater power and flexibility in displaying achievements.
Current initiatives side-step the problem of inter-institutional certification rather than dealing with it.
Although proprietary solutions are starting to appear, they tend to be organisation- rather than user- centric.
This project seeks to address the issue of design for a suitable user-centric "eCertificate" system by working with representatives of the community to establish use case scenarios, to verify this design by building a demonstrator, and then by testing the demonstrator within the group. The demonstrator will be based on a code library which will be developed, and both will be placed in the public domain.
