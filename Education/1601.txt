Welcome
The Combined Regions (TCR) is an organisation set up to enable co-operation between libraries across the British Isles, at both a strategic and an operational level. For more than fifteen years, TCR has been working with its partners to develop a national network for resource-sharing between libraries across Britain and Ireland.
TCR is constituted as a company limited by guarantee, whose members are:
Association of London Chief Librarians
The British Library
Libraries and Information East Midlands
North East libraries
North West Libraries Interlending Partnership
Royal National Institute of Blind People
Society of Chief Librarians, West Midlands
South Western Regional Library Service
Society of Chief Librarians Yorkshire and Humber
TCR works with OCLC on UnityUK, a national union catalogue and interlending system with holdings from all regions of the British Isles. For more information, see our UnityUK page.
Through its Conarls Working Group, TCR operates the Inter-Regional Unit (IRU) Cost Scheme, commonly known as the 'Conarls rate' for inter-library loans, and provides a national forum for working on resource sharing issues.
UnityUK is a trademark of The Combined Regions.
