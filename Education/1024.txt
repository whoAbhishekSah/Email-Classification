Welcome
PERSoNA (Personal Engagement with Repositories through Social Networking Applications) is a JISC funded project that will will link two other JISC funded projects,
Streamline and An Institutional Repository for Leeds Metropolitan University, and provide scope to enhance the outcomes of both.
The Institutional Repository has become the established technology
deployed at universities and other institutions to enable scholars to
self-archive their research outputs; the PERSoNA team will be embedding social networking tools which allow chat, tagging and bookmarking (amongst other things) within the repository, and encouraging users to comment on their use of our repository and make recommendations amongst each other leading to the onward discovery of further resources.
