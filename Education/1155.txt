Children of The Great War at Age Exchange
RunCoCo is proud to have been involved in the community collection and reminiscence project
Children of The Great War
run by Age Exchange, the leading British charity working in the field of Reminiscence Arts, with support from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
Across an 18 month period, Age Exchange worked with many partner organisations across London to record and share family histories from a diverse range of communities -
telling the untold stories of the War and how it affected people in the city. Project activities have included reminiscence projects, intergenerational workshops, filming and recording
of group and individual interviews, including exploring the theme through sharing personal heritage. A series of open days have been held in London Boroughs where the public were
welcomed to contribute family history, images and text to the Europeana 1914-18 International archive.
Age Exchange have integrated the collected memories into a touring exhibition and
film installation, and a major intergenerational theatre production.
The recorded memories, digitalised photographs, letters and text are shared through the
Europeana 1914-18 archive, in support of learning and research into the
Great War by people across Europe.
