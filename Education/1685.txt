Welcome to the Kate Sharpley Library
The Kate Sharpley Library exists to preserve and promote
anarchist history. (More information.)Everything at the Kate Sharpley Library - acquisitions,
cataloguing, preservation work, publishing, answering enquiries is
done by volunteers: we get no money from governments or the business
community. All our running costs are met by donations from members
of the collective, subscribers and supporters, or by the small
income we make through publishing. Please
consider donating
and subscribing. We also try to promote the history of anarchism by publishing
studies based on those materials - or reprints of original documents
taken from our collection. Check out our
books and pamphlets available for sale or explore our
online documents or browse back issues of our Bulletin.Our physical library (in California) includes books, newspapers, pamphlets,
manuscripts and ephemera documenting the history of anarchist
movements. Contact us to arrange a visit.
