What is the ePI study?
The ePI study explored large-scale implementations of e-portfolio use in Higher and Further Education and professional organisations in the UK . It was JISC funded and led by the University of  Nottingham.
The study aimed to:
Identify a range of examples of wide scale e-portfolio implementations within HE/FE institutions and professional bodies that will inform practice/strategy;
Gather a range of case studies to support the articulation of models of implementation;
Develop an appropriate means of disseminating the outcomes that enables a potential user to understand the implementation issues and identify the cases that are most relevant to their own contexts.
These are the criteria that were  used to select insitutions and professional bodies for the study.  The key output was the e-Portfolio Implementation Toolkit and the Final report contains selected information and links to the toolkit. The toolkit is  being disseminated through these key events throughout 2012:Key note at the ePortfolios Australia conference 2012 Australian Catholic University, North Sydney, Australia, 27-28 September 2012Workshop at ALT-C 2012 at the University of Manchester, UK 11-13 September 2012Workshop at epic 2012 the 10th ePortfolio and Identity Conference
