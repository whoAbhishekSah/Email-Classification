[edit]JISC Common Repository Interfaces Group (CRIG)
JISC set up the Common Repository Interfaces Group (CRIG) to help identify problem spaces in the repository landscape and suggest innovative solutions.
The CRIG consists of a core group of technical, policy and development staff with repository interface expertise.
It encourages anyone to join who is dedicated and passionate about surfacing scholarly content on the web.
Please see below for joining details.
