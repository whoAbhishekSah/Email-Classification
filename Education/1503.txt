espida. making it happen, by getting real
Welcome
The
espida Project was completed in January 2007. The model that espida has
developed can help make business cases for proposals that may not
necessarily offer immediate financial benefit to an organisation, but rather
bring benefit in more intangible spheres. While it was designed initially to
be used within the area of digital resource management, it has potential for far wider
application (decision making, performance measurement, change management).
The espida
Handbook details the espida Approach and can be downloaded from
the 'Publications' and the 'Model'
pages.
Papers
about the work and presentations given at various conferences are also
available from the 'Publications' page.
Questions
regarding the project can be directed to
espida@gla.ac.uk.
