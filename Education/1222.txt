The Service Oriented Toolkit for Research Data Management project was co-funded by the JISC Managing Research Data Programme 2011-2013 and The University of Hertfordshire. The project focused on the realisation of practical benefits for operationalising an institutional approach to good practice in RDM. The objectives of the project were to audit current best practice, develop […]

One of the results of the DAF at UH showed that researchers were open to training materials as long as they’re not long-winded or too generic.  However, the results of my interviews in Science and Technology, and interviews in the other research institutes by our champions, show that the best practice for looking after working […]

We planned to produce discipline specific examples DMPs for our researchers.  However, as we prepared our best practice advice we learnt how many of the DMP answers for the working data stages are similar throughout the university in respective of the subject, and that the main differences are in the funding-body requirements for archiving and […]

This is a follow up to my blog post The cost of a bit of a DDUD which examined the total cost of ownership (TCO) of a network attached storage device operated by a research group. The TCO in that case included a malfunction and repair but no data loss. In this post we go […]

In between procrastinating over final reports and filling in odd gaps in our new RDM advice, we are preparing some material on the cost of a data loss event. This will arrive in due course, but I thought it would be useful to precede it with a consideration of the cost of simply owning a […]

Four delegates reporting on two projects, using three posters, three presentations and two demonstrations. And we still had time to come away with more useful collaborations to pursue! The roundup workshop was a great way to see how far we have all come in 18 months, reflect that this is still just the beginning for […]

We have built an installation of ZendTo, which is an opensource system for transferring large files over the web written by Julian Field from University of Southampton, and used at Southampton, Essex and Imperial College. See http://fileexchange.herts.ac.uk/ The requirement for this system came from researchers who were trying to use email to move files larger than about 10MB, resulting […]

Attached to the University of Hertfordshire’s Data Policy is a handy DOs and DON’Ts guide to handling Personal and Confidential Information (PCI). Research data often falls under the definition of PCI, because it is ethically sensitive or has commercial value to the University or a sponsor.  It probably won’t be a surprise to anyone engaged […]

The hybrid cloud approach is being adopted in many organisations, particularly where high quality local infrastructure is in place and is likely to remain useful for a period of years but needs extending or migrating. In these cases the cloud offers expansion of local facilities and a gradual route to full migration. The cloud element […]
