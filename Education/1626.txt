About Dragon Hall

Hiring the hall
We are currently in a period of transition as we campaign to establish a National Centre for Writing at Dragon Hall due to open in 2018. For much of 2017 there will be substantial building and restoration work taking place at Dragon Hall. As a result of this our hiring policy has not been finalised.

About Dragon HallDragon Hall is a rare example of a medieval merchant’s trading complex, built in about 1430 by a merchant, Robert Toppes. Its centrepiece, the magnificent first floor trading hall, is 26 metres long, used more than 500 large oak timbers, was decorated with 15 carved dragons of Baltic oak and has a fine crown post roof. Its survival gives us the opportunity to appreciate the skills of the 15th century timber craftsmen.
But it is more than this. There have been buildings on this site for more than a thousand years. Archaeological research shows us that it was home to Saxon huts, a medieval open hall house, Tudor town houses and a group of crowded Victorian tenements. Evidence of all these can be seen today. It is a unique contribution to the rich architectural, commercial and cultural heritage of Norwich.
After a long programme of restoration it is now the home of Writers' Centre Norwich.
