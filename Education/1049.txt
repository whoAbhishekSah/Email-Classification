LSE Experts Directory
This directory is the first stop for anyone looking for introductions to LSE's staff of world-renowned academics and researchers.
Here you will find:
profiles of academics with a listing of their research outputs and their contact details
keyword listings of their areas of expertise
links to their most recent research papers in LSE's open access repository, LSE Research Online
Most academics have full time teaching and research commitments so they may not be able to respond immediately. Most will be pleased to consider requests for media interviews or approaches from businesses for possible consultancy work.
Browse for experts by:
name
subject area
department or research centre
languages they speak
sector, industry or country to which their research relates
If an expert uses the same 'experience keywords' in their profile as other LSE experts in the directory that keyword will be a link to the other experts using the same keyword. You can also just use the search facility.
Useful links:
In the right hand menu we've highlighted services and sections directly related to our research output, such as LSE Consulting, LSE Research Online (LSE Library's open access repository of research outputs) and LSE public lectures and events.
Journalists:
Email pressoffice@lse.ac.uk  if you cannot find the person you are looking for, or call them on 020 7955 7060.
