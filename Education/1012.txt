Inspiration and Provision for Preservation of Digital Repositories
Repository managers are responsible for managing data within their repositories. One way of looking at digital preservation is as data management for the longer term.
The JISC Preserv 2 project is investigating and developing digital preservation services for repositories, to help repository managers plan for longer-term data management.
"It is important to build the concept of preservation from the outset"*. In the digital era, the 'outset' for most new research and educational materials will be the institutional repository.
* JISC Circular 4/04, note 10
Preservation: managing data for your repository
Challenge yourself. Is your repository in shape for the future?
The Repository
Repositories are changing. Developing your repository architecture, how OAI-ORE helps, and how policy affects your choices.
Storage
Choose and control large-scale storage, local or networked (in the 'cloud').
Preservation Services
Tools, services and help to identify and plan your technical preservation requirements.
The Big Picture
Pulling it all together. Combining repository management, storage and preservation services: 'smart storage'.
