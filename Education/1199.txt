Repository Gateway and Toolkit

An overview of STARGATE
STARGATE has been a series of investigations
into the actual and possible use of the "Specification for
an OAI
Static Repository and an OAI Static Repository Gateway"
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-static-repository.htm
Thus far,
three projects make up the strand
of work:
STARGATE - Static
Repository Gateway and Toolkit:
Enabling small publishers to participate in OAI-based services
The STARGATE extension (which examined
the Static Repository Gateway software)
STARGATE: SCoPE - Selecting Collections
for Possible Exposure
The STARGATE Project
The
STARGATE project
explored the use of static repositories
as a means of exposing publisher metadata to OAI-based disclosure,
discovery and alerting services within the JISC Information Environment
and beyond.
The project's primary aim was to lower
the technical barriers to the implementation of OAI-compliant
repositories, thereby
enabling small publishers of electronic resources to participate
more readily in OAI-based disclosure and delivery services.
The project
worked with four
publishers
in the Library and Information Science domain to explore the
use of OAI static repositories

The STARGATE extension
The project received a short extension
to examine and document in detail the set up and use of Static
Repository Gateways. For more information see the Static Repository
Gateways tab
The STARGATE static repository gateway;
a branded gateway for the publishing community is available
at: http://stargate.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/gateway/
STARGATE: SCoPE
STARGATE SCoPE (Selecting Collections for
Possible Exposure ) is a brief investigation into the demand for
and practicalities of running a Gateway within the context of
the JISC Information Environment
SCoPE’s primary aims are:
to build on the STARGATE project (including the technical
specification)
to develop a business case for a SRG service by:
investigating the market for a SRG service (what collections
can be exposed)
assessing the cost and benefits of such as service (why
such collections would use such a service)
making suggestions about how to promote the uptake
of a SRG service.
The STARGATE strand of work has been funded
by the Joint
Information Systems Committee (JISC) and was
undertaken
by the Centre
for Digital Library Research at the University
of Strathclyde.
