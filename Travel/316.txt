Welcome!
With so many events already planned for 2017, make sure you’re up to date with what’s on in Launceston and the surrounding area! There are markets, community films, festivals, rallies, agricultural shows, concerts, craft fairs, dances, exercise classes and coffee mornings, something for everyone.
Arranging your own event?
Then make sure you post information here for everyone to see and ensure your event is a great success – simply register for an account, login, and enter the details.
Remember to add plenty of details, including venue, ticket prices, time of event and anything else that maybe helpful. It is always better to include too much information than too little!
We will moderate your post, because we have to, and when it’s approved, it will be published on the Launceston 2020 events pages and calendar and (if space allows) included in the Weekly Events List, distributed around the area and to a large database of people who are very interested in finding out what’s on and where to go.
Don’t be shy – spread the word! We’ve included a page on this site with additional guidance on publicising your event further afield, so tell everyone in Cornwall what you are doing.
The Launceston Loyalty Card…..
To ensure Launceston continues to grow make sure you support your local traders. Look out for Love Launceston Loyalty offers in the shops, save as you shop! If you haven’t got your Love Launceston Loyalty Card please call into Launceston Tourist Information Centre in the White Hart Arcade and collect one now.
