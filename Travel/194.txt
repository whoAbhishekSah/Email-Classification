Tamar Valley Tipis Camping Holidays
Experience camping in Sioux style tipis
in the Tamar Valley, an area of outstanding natural beauty
in Cornwall
TAMAR VALLEY TIPIS are located at Deer Park
Farm, a working farm, in a secluded glade above a small pond, overlooking
the magnificent scenery of the Tamar Valley, on the border of Cornwall
and Devon.
The tipis are of Sioux design and have been
made in the USA by Nomadics
Tipi Makers, who also made the tipis for the film Dances
With Wolves. The tipis are decorated with traditional native
American artwork and are particularly striking in appearance.
There
is an abundance of wildlife in the vicinity of the secluded camp
site - deer, rabbits, badgers and otters, etc., many different species
of birds, butterflies, moths and bats. Staying at the camp site will
appeal to those with a love for the countryside and conservation,
wildlife photographers, ornithologists, artists, and walkers, and
those who would seek to leave the city behind and head for the country.
During
your camping holiday, to ensure the peace and tranquility of the
area we ask that you leave noise at home, take nothing but photographs
and memories, leave nothing but footprints, and kill nothing but
time.
Self
Catering Holiday Cottages are also available at Deer Park Farm
