Deer Park Farm Holiday Cottages
Deer Park Farm is a 280 acre family run beef, sheep and arable farm set in the tranquil surroundings of the unspoilt Tamar Valley and enjoys stunning views across to Dartmoor. Formerly owned and farmed by HRH Prince Charles, Duke of Cornwall, the area is steeped in history dating back to the 14th Century when it was an ancient Royal Deer Park. Today's visitors are welcome to see the many farming activities throughout the seasons - from lambing in the springtime through silage and haymaking and into harvest in autumn.
Deer Park Farm holiday accommodation comprises three self-catering cottages, delightfully converted from traditional stone barns, the conversion having allowed many original features to be retained.
