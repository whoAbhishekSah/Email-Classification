Offering
genealogical and family history data, including Baptisms, Marriages and Burials,
for St. Austell, Charlestown, and Treverbyn, St. Blazey, Tywardreath, St. Ewe, and Par - with material to help 'fill
out the outline'.
What's new -
* We've added Tewington Manorial Records - from Original Documents held by CRO. The first, a register of sales of lands extending from 1540 through 1790, includes a wide variety of persons.
* we've added a simple SITE MAP - you can reach data or whatever interests you in a few clicks!!
* Made additions to St. Austell births, 1765 - and made some corrections. Updating will be ongoing.
* And in the "LIFE" section, we have photographs and transcriptions of the ST. EWE War Memorial, and a description of the church. Also Notes from the Register 1630 to 1830, which describe the parish boundaries in 1630, etc. courtesy of Fran.
Additional data will be included as quickly as possible.
* LDS Familysearch.org website now has
all of the Church of England registers for the parishes shown above on their website. These are the original pages of the registers - although the "originals" might be copies created centuries ago.
* Please be sure to look at all the other materials such as Manorial Records, Tax returns, etc. on this site - it might help you break down one of your walls.
I'm
always interested in gathering new material for the site; if you have something
you wish to donate, or something you want me to add, please let me know. I'll
be glad to hear from you!
Thanks, Julia

You
may search the site by putting either a place name or surname in the box below. ALWAYS TRY ALTERNATIVE SPELLINGS!!!
What might also help is to search using 'alternative' characters [wildcards] of * and ? --- Normally, ? represents a single character, and * is zero or more characters ----
For example -
dav*y - will return all spellings with 'dav' plus zero or more characters, followed by a y.
jul*an - will return all spellings with 'jul' plus zero or more characters, followed by 'an', ie julyyan
or jul?an - will return all spellings with 'jul' and one character, followed by 'an'. Should return Julian and Julyan.
