Welcome
WelcomeA Message from Derek
Welcome to my official website. This is the very best place for you to find out about my career and to keep up to date with what I’m up to at the moment.
Since retiring from elite sport, I’ve kept myself busy especially with my  keynote speaking and media appearances. Learn more about all of that and the different ways I’m able to help your company or brand.
Thank you for taking the time to visit my site!
“Derek Redmond bravely making it through with little help, moments of euphoria after years of hard work. Moments when the human spirit triumphs over injury that should have been impossible to overcome."
-President Barack Obama

“Derek provided some valuable insights into team building/leadership by expressing them in a sporting context. His delivery was professional, funny, honest and extremely engaging. Furthermore, whilst off the stage as well as on, he was very personable and endeared himself to everyone in the team.”
