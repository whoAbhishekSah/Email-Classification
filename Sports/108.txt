Welcome to the Lake District Osprey Project website and the Excitement of their 2016 migration. Crossed fingers they all make the desert crossing!
Our adult female KL left for Senegal in August. The tracker on Bega our 2016 female juvenile has sadly stopped transmitting, East of Senegal – we can only hope it is a technical failure but it is not a hospitable place for survival . No 14 our ‘Star’ traveller, hatched 2013, is back in Bioko..  Unring our adult male will also be sitting in the sun somewhere South.
Exhibition and viewpoints. Our last day of opening was Monday 29th August. BUT keep up with the diary!
Keep reading the Diary over the winter for occasional updates on our birds and other wildlife.
internet live streaming will start again next season pobably in April.

Whinlatter v Bioko. Where would a bird rather be?
At 5.00 am this morning Number 14 was alive and well and moving around his habitat on the southern side of Bioko. Although rainy at the moment he has a nice Christmas weekend to look forward to with temperature’s dropping to 24 degrees C. with lots of sunshine.
Ho! Ho! Ho!
