WHCG - Welsh Harp Conservation Group
Brent
Reservoir
WHCG BOOK
The Brent reservoir, or
'Welsh Harp' as it is more commonly known, is situated on the borders of the
London boroughs of Brent and Barnet. The site is frequently considered for
development, and the need for a body dedicated to preserving its current status
as a SSSI and an important breeding site for wildfowl has been demonstrated
with alarming frequency.
The Welsh Harp
Conservation Group (WHCG) was formed in 1972, and works in close liaison with
both Brent and Barnet councils. It was formed to protect the area, not only as
a habitat for a variety of birdlife and rare species of flora, but in the
interests of public recreation.
The aim of this
Website is to publicise the existence of the Welsh Harp, bring updates and news
to existing patrons and allow general discussion on any birding issues. I hope
that you find your visit worthwhile.

REQUEST Dec 2006
I originally developed this site for the
Welsh Harp Conservation Group in 1999.
I no longer live in the area, but I am still committed to keeping the Harp free from harm and I am happy to continue to host the Web site on my
server space.
It is worth noting that the site still receives significant
traffic, and has been featured in at least three publications and a big local advertising campaign. In addition, the British Library have requested permission to archive
the Web site as a reflection of local conservation in this era.
This leads me to feel that the site deserves a serious amount of updating, and I would be happy to put a little work into doing so if someone connected to the Group (or perhaps a local with their permission) were to give me some
material.
