In his closing speech IPC President Sir Philip Craven described London 2012 as "the greatest Paralympic Games ever" and with record crowds, numbers of broadcasters and athletes and countries taking part combined with record breaking performances from athletes and unprecedented media coverage it was easy to see why.The Games had a significant impact on British society. Research ahead of the Closing Ceremony found:• 1 in 3 UK adults changed their attitude towards people with an impairment; • 65% agree the Paralympics delivered a breakthrough in the way people with an impairment are viewed in the country – up from a 40% expectation in June 2010;• eight out of ten (81%) British adults thought the Paralympics had a positive impact on the way people with an impairment are viewed by the public; • the Paralympic Games is about ability, not disability – and are about what people can do, not what they can’t do.Click here to view a highlights video of London 2012's "Best Games Ever."London 2012 guides and policies can be found here.London 2012 Qualification Criteria

TORCH RELAY
IPC President Sir Philip Craven was among the first five Torchbearers to carry the London 2012 Paralympic Flame after it was created at an emotional ceremony at Stoke Mandeville Stadium.He was joined by four other legends of the Paralympics – Baroness Susan Masham of Ilton, Caz Walton, Sally Haynes and Jane Blackburn – after the four national flames were joined at the birthplace of the Paralympic Movement.The Paralympic Flame then left on a 92-mile journey to the Olympic Stadium in a 24-hour torch relay that involved 580 Torchbearers working in teams of five.Prior to the Stoke Mandeville event, National Flames were created at the summit of the highest peaks of the four home nations: Scafell Pike (England), Snowdon/Yr Wyddfa (Wales), Ben Nevis (Scotland) and Slieve Donard (Northern Ireland).The four individual Flames were then placed in a miner's lantern and transferred to the nation's capital cities. Paralympic celebrations took place in London, Belfast Edinburgh and Cardiff.Find out more about the London 2012 Torch Relay here.
