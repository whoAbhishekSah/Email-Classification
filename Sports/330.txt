BRYONY SHAW
GB OLYMPIC WINDSURFER
FOLLOW HER ON HER JOURNEY TO RIO 2016
MY STORY
I am a determined character with a will to win and I have set my sights on windsurfing Gold at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games 2016. I have competed with the best from a young age and won Bronze, aged 24, at my first Olympic Games in Beijing.
Steady performances throughout my career have made me one of the main players in the RS:X Olympic Class, and my many appearances on the top step of the podium show that my international record is a force to be reckoned with.

SPONSORS
You can be the best athlete in the world with the greatest work ethic and 100% commitment, but without the support that sponsors bring, you will be behind all your competitors on the start line. If you’d like to find out more about becoming a sponsor to help me achieve full potential at Rio 2016, then please contact me via the simple form at the bottom of this page.
