Derwent Water
Beatrix holidayed on the shores of Derwent Water and set many of her stories here. The locations are recognisable in her tales about Mrs Tiggy-Winkle, Squirrel Nutkin and Benjamin Bunny. This year, nearby Wordsworth House will display some of Beatrix’s orignal artworks.

Allan Bank
Allan Bank was home to Canon Rawnsley, Beatrix’s lifelong friend and mentor. To celebrate this friendship, an exhibition at the house will ask visitors what inspires them. Allan Bank still has the atmosphere of a bustling family home, and a lively programme of music and events.
Yew Tree Farm
Yew Tree is an iconic Lakes farm, bequeathed to The National Trust by Beatrix Potter. As part of the celebrations this year, you have the rare opportunity to view inside Yew Tree Farm cottage and sample some of their heritage Herdwick meat, at the farm Open Day in July.
The Lingholm Estate
The Lingholm Estate was the Potter’s favourite Lakeland holiday home. They rented the house ten times between 1885 and 1907. Beatrix credited the Lingholm Kitchen Gardens as her original inspiration for Mr McGregor’s garden and in June 2016 they are opening a stunning new café.

Beatrix Potter works to Japan
To mark the 150th anniversary of the birth of Beatrix Potter, we are participating in an unprecedented loan of material relating to Peter Rabbit to a major exhibition in Japan. Much of this material has never left the United Kingdom, including the 44 original black ink drawings that Beatrix Potter created for the first privately printed edition of The Tale of Peter Rabbit. The collection of drawings, letters, toys and other Peter Rabbit memorabilia will travel to seven different venues in Japan before returning in the autumn of 2017.

Beatrix Potter's 17th-century farmhouse: a time-capsule of her life
Enjoy the tale of Beatrix Potter by visiting Hill Top. Full of her favourite things, this house appears as if Beatrix had just stepped out for a walk. Every room contains a reference to a picture in a 'tale'.
The lovely cottage garden is a haphazard mix of flowers, herbs, fruit and vegetables. Make your way up the garden path to the front door and see for yourself why Beatrix loved this place. Bought in 1905 with proceeds from her first book, the Tale of Peter Rabbit, she used Hill Top itself and the surrounding countryside as inspiration for many of her subsequent books.
Hill Top is a small house and a timed-ticket system is in operation to avoid overcrowding and to protect the interior. Hill Top can be very busy and visitors may sometimes have to wait to enter the house.
Please note: tickets cannot be booked in advance and early sell-outs are possible.

What is Gift Aid?
Most of our places run the Gift Aid on Entry scheme at their admission points. Under this scheme, if you're not a member you have the choice of two entry tickets:
Gift Aid Admission or
Standard admission
If the place runs Gift Aid on Entry, we'll offer you the Gift Aid Admission prices. But it's entirely up to you which ticket you choose. If you want the Standard Admission instead, just let us know when you come to pay.
Gift Aid Admission includes a 10 per cent or more voluntary donation. Gift Aid Admissions let us reclaim tax on the whole amount paid* — an extra 25 per cent — potentially a very significant boost to our places' funds.
An extra £1 paid under the scheme can be worth over £3 to the National Trust as shown below: Payment of the additional percentage donation is entirely voluntary, so if you prefer to pay the standard admission please advise our reception staff at the till point.
