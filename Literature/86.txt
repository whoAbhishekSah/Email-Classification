Welcome
Welcome to The William Morris Society, founded in 1955 to make the life, work and ideas of William Morris (1834-96) better known.  Our purpose is to share knowledge of the life and works of William Morris amongst our members and the wider public.

About the society
An introduction to William Morris
William Morris (24 March 1834 – 3 October 1896) was a revolutionary force in Victorian Britain whose work dramatically changed the fashions and ideologies of the era. As a craftsman, designer, poet, printer, socialist, novelist, and environmentalist, Morris was not only influential in his own time, but his legacy remains alive and important today.
