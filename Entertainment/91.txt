The Gypsy Roma Traveller Achievement Service has become part of the Closing the Gap team in Leeds. As a consequence the website at www.grtleeds.co.uk can no longer be maintained and has been removed. Emails sent to this domain will no longer be received.
Please call the Closing the Gap team on 0113 224 3796 if you were seeking information, help or advice.
We hope that the informational content of the website will be used elsewhere in the near future. If this proves to be the case links will be added here in due course.
Thank you for your support and visits over the years.
