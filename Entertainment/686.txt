Birmingham and the West Midlands as a whole brought the Olympic and Paralympic Games to life for millions of people.
From hosting Training Camps and Olympic Football to staging world-class cultural performances and events, we certainly played our part in making London 2012 a huge success.
Our story and plans - Find out more about what we did to bring London 2012 to life in the region and how you can continue your Olympic or Paralympic journey right here.
Culture - The Cultural Olympiad gave people everywhere a chance to be part of London 2012. This programme of world-class performances produced some unforgettable moments here in the West Midlands.
Torch - For 7 days during the summer of 2012, Olympic Torch fever embraced Birmingham and the region placing a spotlight on our people and places.
Business - The creativity and ingenuity of businesses across the region ensured that the West Midlands were awarded over half a billion pounds worth of contracts from the Games.
Volunteers - Thousands of people across the region gave up their time to make the Games a success right here, including the University of Birmingham volunteers praised by the Jamaican track and field team.
