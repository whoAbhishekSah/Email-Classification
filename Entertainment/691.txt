Dear old Hackney Wick
The place of our abode
There is no other in the land, it beats the mile end road
It's there that we were born; it's there that we will stick
There is no other in the land like dear old hackney wick
Have a banana !
The Wick curiosity shop is a small scale archive and cultural
space dedicated to the specific locality of Hackney Wick and Fish
Island. It documents, hosts and promotes. It is an eclectic
collection of local produce, memorabilia, oral history, songs and
stories from or about Hackney Wick. The Archive exists on-line and
as a series of live events in which it temporarily assembles. The
display and the format the shop is continuously changing. The list
of curiosities is growing, slowly collecting an extensive list of
contributions made in or inspired by Hackney Wick and the
surrounding area.
The Wick Curiosity Shop presents a narrative understanding of
the area, A space full of stories about the Wick told in a
multitude of ways. It is an archive of local cultural activities
and artefacts that help to document the process of change in the
area with the close involvement of its local residents.
The Wick Curiosity Shop is as much an archive as it is an event
structure and platform for futher cultural activity. It allows
existing histories to be collected and new memories to be formed,
thus capturing the life of a community in transition through a
series of close engagements. Archiving and registering what seems
relevant from the viewpoint of the Wick and its residence and
users.
This website brings all contributions and events together in one
place. You can brows the shop either by looking for individual
contributors, by searching all contributions or by events when the
shop was open and on site. To find out more about the day to day
running of the Wick Curiosity Shop you can visit our blog for more
details. Contact us if you would like to contribute something to
the shop or spotted something that needs further explanation. You
can also join our mailing list to stay informed about future
events.
The Wick Curiosity Shop was originally commissioned by [SPACE]
for the Hackney Wick Festival in September 2008. It is a
collaboration between public works and Hilary Powell from
Optimistic Productions with the generous support of Pudding Mill
River.
