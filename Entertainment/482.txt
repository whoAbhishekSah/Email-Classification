Welcome to Lap of Honour, a collection of interviews with Olympians, Paralympians and people from Suffolk who have taken part in the Games.
This oral history project has captured young people in training and older Games participants reflecting on their achievements.
The interviews focus on individuals sharing their own perspective about sport, training, selection, funding and London 2012.
The short films and audio recordings are accompanied by transcripts and photographs.
